The Arts House (also known as the Old Parliament House) is where the Singapore Parliament used to sit. Located at Empress Place, it was originally built as a residence in 1827 but was ended up being used as courthouse for most part of the 19th century. During this period, the building also underwent many alterations and extensions allowing the architecture of the building to be transformed from the Palladian style to Victorian.
