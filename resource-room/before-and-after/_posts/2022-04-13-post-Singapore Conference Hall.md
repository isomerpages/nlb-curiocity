The Singapore Conference Hall on Shenton Way is a historical landmark. Completed in 1965, it is formerly known as the Singapore Conference Hall and Trade Union House and had served as the headquarters of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) from 1965 to 2000. After extensive renovation works, it was reopened in 2001 as the home of the Singapore Chinese Orchestra. The building was gazetted as a national monument on 28 December 2010.
