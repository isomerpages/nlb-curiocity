Initially known as Commercial Square, Raffles Place has undergone many changes since it was demarcated as a commercial district in the 1822 Singapore Town Plan. During the colonial period, Raffles Place witnessed the construction of a series of architecturally beautiful buildings that housed mercantile companies, banks and shops. By the time Singapore gained independence in 1965, Raffles Place had become a prime location surrounded by some of the finest looking buildings in the country.
