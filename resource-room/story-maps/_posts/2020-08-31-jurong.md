Jurong was transformed between the 1960s to the 1980s into Singapore’s first industrial estate. This was part of the government’s plan to generate mass employment through industrialisation. Once a swampland, Jurong rapidly developed into a self-sufficient new town with housing, social and leisure amenities. Today, Jurong has embarked on its latest phase of redevelopment as the largest commercial and regional hub outside Singapore’s city centre.
