Choa Chu Kang and Lim Chu Kang derived their names from the&nbsp;village settlements that sprang out in the northwestern part of Singapore following the proliferation of gambier and pepper plantations in the area&nbsp;during the early 19th century. Since then, the area&nbsp;has witnessed significant changes. Today, Choa Chu Kang is a modern, self-sufficient new town, while&nbsp;Lim Chu Kang is Singapore’s agrotechnology hub and eco-tourism destination.
