### **A Place for Food**

Besides leisure, Bras Basah was also known for its restaurants, coffee shops and cafes. Patronised by people from all walks of life, these places clearly show the long history of Singapore’s foodie culture. Below is a photo essay that highlights some of these eateries.

-----

##### **Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant**

The premises of today’s Hotel Rendezvous at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Prinsep Street was once occupied by a stretch of shophouses. Constructed during the early 1900s, they were known for their businesses which included a hotel, photography studios, sport equipment shops, bookshops and coffeshops. The most famous of them, however, was Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant.

| In 1987, the restaurant moved from its Bras Basah premises to Raffles City. Today, it is located at The Central in Clarke Quay. However, its presence in Bras Basah was so iconic that the hotel that occupied its former site named itself after the restaurant.

I remember the glass windows decorated with gold letters, through which one could see the rows of Nasi Padang dishes displayed on the shelves of the glass cabinet beside the window."</span>

##### **Long Bar and the Singapore Sling**

Long Bar in Raffles Hotel was among the oldest food establishments in the Bras Basah area. Sharing a history with the hotel itself, Long Bar was a popular haunt among plantation owners during the early 1900s and was commonly referred to as the ‘Rendezvous of Planters’ at the time.

| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-long-bar-1.jpg)  |
| Back then, Long Bar was not a formal bar. It comprised tables and chairs put up in the Cad Alley wing of the hotel facing Bras Basah Road. Patrons would sit at there while mingling and relaxing with their drinks and snacks. (Image Credit: [Singapore Tourism Board Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/88ad427e-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"})|
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-long-bar-2.jpg)  |
| Long Bar is most well-known as the birthplace of the Singapore Sling, which is an internationally recognised cocktail. It was created by the hotel’s bartender Ngiam Tong Boon in 1915. Primarily a gin-based cocktail, Ngiam made the beverage pink so as to allow the ladies at the time to consume it in the public.

**In 2015, the Singapore Sling celebrates its 100th anniversary. Watch the video below by Raffles Hotel explaining the history of the iconic made-in-Singapore drink.**

##### **Hainanese Chicken Rice**

A ubiquitous sight in hawker centres across Singapore, the Hainanese chicken rice is also on the menu in many major restaurants and even hotel cafés. Regardless where it is found or how much it cost, this dish is more or less prepared this way: bite-sized slices of chicken — or a whole chicken if you’re eating as a big group — served with fragrant rice, spicy chilli and ginger paste. In Singapore, the Hainanese Chicken Rice is said to have taken root in areas like Middle Road and Purvis Street during the pre-war years. As such, Bras Basah could be seen as the place of origin for the beloved local fare.

| | 
|:--------:| 
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-chicken-rice-1.jpg) |
| As its name implies, Hainanese chicken rice has links to the Hainanese community. Hailing from Hainan province in China, the Hainanese, like the other Chinese communities here, formed enclaves and settled in different parts of Singapore, including Middle Road (pictured) in the Bras Basah area. (Image Credit: [From the Lee Kip Lin Collection. All rights reserved. Lee Kip Lin and National Library Board, Singapore 2009](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/image-detail?cmsuuid=9c8d8068-9696-4f51-ae5b-e6717919ab3e){:target="_blank"})|
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-chicken-rice-2.jpg)   |
| In fact, the area around Bras Basah was a Hainanese enclave. Other than the presence of the Hainan Clan Association, which still stands prominently along Seah Street today, Middle Road, Purvis Street (pictured) and Seah Street were used to be called “Hainan First Street”, “Hainan Second Street”, and “Hainan Third Street” respectively. (Image Credit: [From the Lee Kip Lin Collection. All rights reserved. Lee Kip Lin and National Library Board, Singapore 2009](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/image-detail?cmsuuid=487b5bfd-e393-414c-88d2-7a9c7644c9b2){:target="_blank"})|
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-chicken-rice-3.jpg)   |
| However, the Hainanese chicken rice was not the only famous delicacy that they created. There were others including Hainanese-inspired Western dishes (think Hainanese pork chops) and our local Nanyang coffee which in turn led to the creation of kopitams (or coffee shops). Today, eateries serving these Hainanese food including the Hainanese Chicken Rice can still be found in the area including the above Seah Street. (Image Credit: [From the Lee Kip Lin Collection.

<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">"The recipe for the dish is adapted from early Chinese immigrants from Hainan Island, off the southern coast of China. Back in Hainan, locals call the dish "Wenchang chicken". They use a particular fowl that is bony and fibrous, and serve the chicken with oily rice. A ground green chilli dip rounds off the dish.
<br>
<br>[In Singapore], [t]he cooking method hails back to its Hainanese roots, with a few uniquely [local] twists. The chicken is steeped in boiling water or blanched till it is fully cooked, before soaking it in cold water to ensure the meat remains tender. In a local twist, the chicken can also be roasted or braised in soya sauce for a different taste...It is, however, the rice and chilli sauce that can make or break the dish. The rice, cooked in chicken stock with ginger and pandan leaves, should have just the right amount of oiliness, while the chilli must possess the right blend of both spiciness and sourness."</span>

##### **Red House (Baker's Bakery)**

At the junction of Bras Basah Road and Victoria Street opposite present day CHIJMES where the Carlton Hotel now stands, there used to be a bakery called Baker's Bakery and Confectionery or better known as Red House. Due to its reasonably priced set meals as well as signature cakes and curry puffs, it was very popular among residents and students from schools in the area. The Red House was also said to be where eminent local watercolourist Ong Kim Seng would meet fellow painters every Sunday before heading to the Singapore River to paint during the 1960s.

It was about the best part of our breakfast."</span>

##### **Magnolia Snack Bar**

Before Swensen's and Haagen Dazs, Singaporeans after a sweet treat would head down to the Magnolia Snack Bar at Capitol Building. Opened as Creameries Milk Bar in 1937 within the premises of Capitol building, the Magnolia Snack Bar was a popular venue for social gatherings for both the young and old. It was also the go-to place for pre- and post-movie bites.

|  |
|:---:|
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-magnolia-1.jpg) |
| Also referred to as "Magnolia Milk Bar", the diner, as seen on the extreme left of the photograph above, was well-known for its milkshakes and house brand ice creams along with sandwiches, hot dogs and hamburgers. The joint was also fondly remembered by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong who said in a [2001 interview](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes20010528-1.2.26.3.8) that it was "something special" to visit the snack bar when he was a young boy and his grandmother would bring him and his two siblings there for ice-cream.

However, all of them had wound up by 1988.

(Source: <a href="http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singmonitor19841216-1.2.44.3.1" target="_blank">NewspaperSG</a>)</span></summary>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">"The most fascinating thing about eating there is the menu which has preserved the Fifties touch featuring such old fashioned names as Merry Widow ($2.75), Knickerbocker Casablanca ($3.20) and Pear Berry Fantasy ($2.70). Then there are the old colonial dishes of Pork Sausages, Eggs with Toast and Butter, Peas and Chips for $3.90, Chicken Curry with Rice and condiments for $5.90 and Fish and Chips with toast and butter for $6.50. I had thought a snack bar like that would have gone out of fashioned with its vinyl floors, old-fashioned and no-frills décor and plain service…Yet the ambience was surprisingly pleasant and had the air of a haven away from the frenzy of city life. It is air-conditioned and a pleasant place to go to if you intend to meet some friends where the conversation and company counts more than the food…it [can also be] a place for dating, as a meal there for two can cost under $20 and the bus stops are located nearby."</span>

##### **Street Hawkers of Old Bras Basah**

From the pre-war years until the late 1970s, the streets of Bras Basah, like many parts of the city, were lined with street hawkers. One of Singapore’s most valuable heritage traditions, food hawking has been around since the early 1800s, a livelihood for early immigrants of the island.

| The street hawkers of old Bras Basah could be found on roads such as Middle Street and Queen Street. It was said that the former was lined with mostly Malay hawkers, while the latter Chinese.

| Waterloo Street was another place in Bras Basah where street food was sold. Famous for its Indian rojak and sarabat stalls - or drink stalls that sell local coffee, tea, soft drinks or "serbat" which means "ginger tea" or more commonly known as “teh halia". Some of these stalls were generations old, with their origins dating as far back as the late 1800s. (Image Credit: [From the Lee Kip Lin Collection. All rights reserved.

|In addition to Indian Rojak, tau huay (soya beancurd) was another type of food that could be found among the street hawkers in the area between the 1950s and 1970s. One of the most popular stalls at the time was located at the intersection of Beach Road and Rochor Road. Operated by Xu Jun Jie and his wife Madam Tan Jin Jiao through a pushcart similar to the one above, their tau huay was known for its super-smooth texture. It still can be found today in the Rochor Original Beancurd shop in Short Street.

|"Kacang Puteh", which means "white nuts", refers to the sugar-coated peanut snack. Sold by immigrants from India, it was among the most popular street food between the 1950s and 1970s. The street vendors selling the snack would usually wrapped the nuts in thin paper cones made from pages ripped out of old newspapers, magazines and school exercise books. They would sell a variety of up to 20 kinds of nuts and snacks such as steamed nuts, fried peanuts in crispy batter as well as the muruku. By the 1990s, these street vendors had mostly disappeared from the streets and could be found only in cinema lobbies. If you want to try it out today, they are still by a Mr Amirthaalangaram Moorthy in front of Peace Centre. (Image Credit: [The Straits Times © Singapore Press Holdings Limited.

| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/old-chang-kee.jpg) |
| Another food that has a connection with the cinemas of old Bras Basah is the curry puff. Perhaps the most famous was the "Rex curry puffs". As the name implies, they were found at a stall in a coffee shop near Rex Cinema on Mackenzie Road. Selling one curry puff at 35 cents, the stall was opened by an Hainanese immigrant called Chang Chuan Boon in 1973. Previously, Chang sold his puffs as a street hawker at Koek Road before moving to Albert Street and then Mackenzie Road. Today, although Rex Cinema is no longer around, Chang's curry puffs are still highly sought in Singapore through an islandwide network of stalls known as Old Chang Kee.

|Today, the street hawkers of old Bras Basah have been relocated to proper hawker centres such as the above Albert Centre Market and Food Centre where the standards of safety and hygiene are much higher. Although authorities had been trying to move hawkers from the streets since the colonial period, it was only during the late 1970s that they were successful. This was mostly due to the more direct approach taken by the then Ministry of Environment. Despite the shift, the government was aware of the intangible influence that these hawkers have on the culture of Singapore. To see how they were being feted as a national treasure, you can watch the video below by the National Heritage Board.
