Besides being a site for the British to project its power, Fort Canning Hill was also used for recreational activities. In fact, for the past two centuries, the hill was home to not only parks and gardens, but also an aquarium, a swimming pool and even a theatre.

### **The First Botanic Garden**

The [Singapore Botanic Gardens](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_545_2005-01-24.html) today is not the first botanic garden of Singapore. Prior to its establishment in 1859, the British had already explored this idea when they set up a "Botanical and Experimental Garden" on the slopes of Fort Canning Hill.

It would perhaps be impossible to picture to the mind a situation better calculated in every respect to accomplish the ends of such an institution than that, which Singapore represents in reality, placed under circumstances the most favourable for indigenous as well as foreign vegetation and forming part of the richest archipelago in the world - its soil yielding none in fertility, its climate not exceeded by any in uniformity, mildness and salubrity. It abounds in an endless variety of plants equally interesting to the botanist, the agriculturist and the gardener, with unrivalled facilities and opportunities of disseminating these treasures and exchanging them for others...I beg leave to recommend that a suitable piece of ground may be appropriated in the neighbourhood of the European town for the purposes of a botanic garden and for the experimental cultivation of the indigenous plants of Singapore and the adjacent Islands, as well as of such others of foreign growth, as it might be desirable to submit to a skillful trial, previous to encouraging their general introduction. The expenses of such a garden would, I imagine, be moderate; that they would in the event be infinitely compensated by the beneficial results, which the public at large would derive from its influence."</span>

| The motivation behind the establishment of the first botanic garden in Singapore was linked to the colonial tradition of having such gardens within the Empire for the experimental cultivation of cash crops as well as the research of native plants. In fact, when Wallich brought the idea up to Raffles, he was serving as the superintendent of the Calcutta Botanic Garden (shown above) which has been around since 1787.

| Raffles had been toying with the idea of establishing a botanic garden in Singapore since his arrival in 1819. In fact, by the time Wallich submitted his proposal in 1822, there was already an experimental "spice garden" on Fort Canning Hill. Referred to as "Government Garden" by Raffles, it was set up by Singapore's First Resident and Commandant Major-General William Farquhar. The garden had at least some 125 nutmeg trees (shown above) and other crops including clove trees. (Image Credit: [Courtesy of the British Library](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nutmeg_Tree_-_40_drawings_of_plants_at_Bencoolen,_Sumatra_(c.1824)_-_BL_NHD_48-23.jpg){:target="_blank"}) |
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-parks-1-1-1.jpg)|
| To enable the establishment of the botanic garden that Wallich proposed, Raffles made a personal donation of 1,000 dollars and allocated a 19-hectare site on Fort Canning Hill as shown in this 1828 "Plan of the Town of Singapore". Encompassing the "Government Garden" that Farquhar had established earlier, the grounds of the proposed botanic garden was bounded by Selegie Road to the east, Hill Street to the south and "any extent of ground required" to the north. (Image Credit: [Courtesy of the National Library Board](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nutmeg_Tree_-_40_drawings_of_plants_at_Bencoolen,_Sumatra_(c.1824)_-_BL_NHD_48-23.jpg)|
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-gardens-botanic-4.jpg)|
| Surgeon William Montgomerie was appointed as the supervisor of the botanic garden. Despite being given a budget of only 60 Spanish dollar and manpower of 14 labourers including 3 convicts, he was able to build up the garden quite impressively. By 1827, it had some 900 plants, mostly nutmeg and clove trees and seedlings. Furthermore, at the front of the garden, there was "a brick wall with pillars, and intervals of wood work", while its hill-facing side was bordered up with bamboo fence. In addition, the lower grounds of the gardens were also drained to make way for roads. Montgomerie's work is captured in his 8 February 1827 report to the Resident Councillor of Singapore shown above. (Source: [Montgomerie, William. (1827, February 8). Report upon the present State of the Honorable Company’s Botanical and Experimental Garden at Singapore.](https://www.nas.gov.sg/citizenarchivist/Documents/Transcribe?itemId=6065&collectionId=43){:target="_blank"})|
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/bb-map-2.jpg)|
| However, due to high upkeep, coupled with a lack of funding and government support, the garden was eventually closed in June 1829. Its land was then parcelled out for various public projects including the [Armenian Apostolic Church of St. Gregory the Illuminator](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_809_2004-12-23.html) as shown in 1839 survey map of Singapore town prepared by George D. Coleman.(Image Credit: [Courtesy of National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/fb0ace86-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"})|

### **Christian Cemetery**

Besides the "Botanical and Experimental Garden", Fort Canning Hill was also the site of one of Singapore's earliest Christian burial grounds. Encompassing two burial sites, with the first being used from 1819 to 1822 and the second from 1822 to 1865, the cemetery was closed to further burials after the completion of Bukit Timah Christian Cemetery. Today, the former Fort Canning Cemetery has been converted into a park.

|   | 
|:--------:| 
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-cemetery-1.jpg)|
| The first burial site of Fort Canning Cemetery was located near the hilltop, close to the bungalow that Raffles built. At least three burials were made here. The first was that of John Casamajor, a Commercial Resident of the British East India Company and judge who was visiting from India. He died in Singapore on 1 February 1821. The other two burials were those of John Carnegy, a ship captain who died on 12 February 1821, and John Collingwood, a ship commander who died on 21 November 1821. The cemetery was discontinued at the end of 1822 after it was found to be too close to Raffles’s residence. There are no visible traces of this cemetery unlike the second site which is shown here. (Image Credit: [Courtesy of the National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/ae0977b4-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-cemetery-2.jpg) |
| The second burial site was located on the slopes of Fort Canning Hill. This two-acre parcel soon became full so the then resident chaplain Reverend Robert Burn, the then resident chaplain applied for a new burial site in 1827. This request resulted in the cemetery to be enlarged instead. Due to the restricted size of the cemetery, segregation of Protestant and Catholic burials was not enforced strictly until 1845. In the same year, the cemetery was again extended to include land to the east of the central path, and in 1846, a brick wall and a pair of gates of Gothic design were built to enclose the cemetery. Around the time of the wall’s construction, two arches were built on the south (seaward) and the land-facing sides of the burial ground.

| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-cemetery-3.jpg) |
| As the cemetery’s burial register had been lost, the government hired H. A. Stallwood to recompile the burial register by copying details from gravestones. Although his task was complicated by the poor condition of some of the tombstones as well as the haphazard and crowded layout of the cemetery, he was able to complete it. His findings, which came with the above plan showing the locations of all the tombs and monuments there, were later published in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1912. (Image Credit:  Extracted from [Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, July 1953](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=4982709){:target="_blank"})|
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-cemetery-4.jpg) |
| By the end of 1863, the cemetery was full again, and a new site in Bukit Timah was identified as an alternative burial site. Between 1822 and 1865, more than 600 burials took place at the Fort Canning Cemetery. Around one-third of these burials were those of Chinese Christians. Today, visitors can still find the traces of the old Christian cemetery on Fort Canning Hill. These include the cemetery’s two Gothic gates, the James Brooke Napier Memorial that was built in memory of the infant son of William and Maria Frances Napier, as well as two dome-shaped cupolas.

### **King George V Park (Today's Jubilee Park)**

King George V Park was located southwest of Fort Canning Hill at the junction of River Valley Road and Clemenceau Avenue. It was named this way to to mark the 1935 silver jubilee of King George V and Queen Mary. The park was very popular during the postwar period and was known for its lush greenery and towering trees. In 1972, it was incorporated into today's Fort Canning Park before being revived as Jubilee Park in 2019.

Scores of scraggy kids can be seen emerging from their rambling homes a stone's throw away, like rabbits out of their holes, to play on the green grass in the cool of the evening. It is a familiar sight to see a group of five or six boys lolling on the grass in a shady nook or playing a game of imitation Blind Man's Bluff. From 5.30 or 6 p.m. onwards every day, one can see a flow of these children into the park, from babes-in-arms to the age of adolescence. Some are accompanied by their parents. Peals of laughter rise above the din of the busy traffic and the park rings with a hundred gay young voices of children at play. The few swings and chutes that are there to delight the kiddies and young visitors are always occupied. In another corner, some wide-eyed toddler is being fed by Mama. A large number of these children, shut out from all sunlight in their rickety homes across the road, are in need of fresh air and sunshine more than food. Although it doesn't boast of being a second Hype Park, this green enclosure with its many shady trees and flowering shrubs is regarded by many as the Colony's most beautiful public garden."</span>

### **Former Recreational Grounds of Fort Canning Hill**

King George V Park was not the only recreational grounds in Fort Canning Hill, there were also others including the River Valley Swimming Complex, the Van Kleef Aquarium and the National Theatre. Although these places are no longer around, they were very popular during the postwar period right up to the nation-building years.

##### **National Theatre**

Completed in 1963, the National Theatre was one of the most iconic buildings of the nation-building years. Situated in King George V Park, it was used as a cultural venue for performances, concerts and conferences before being demolished in 1986 due to structural reasons.

|   | 
|:--------:| 
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-parks-theatre-1.jpg)|
| The National Theatre was known for its iconic architecture. Designed by local architect Alfred Wong, it featured an open-air auditorium with a magnificent 150-tonne cantilevered steel roof overhanging an open-air auditorium. The supporting wall for the roof had five vertical diamond-shaped bays that formed the distinctive frontage of the theatre. In 1965, a crescent-shaped fountain was added in front of the five diamond frontage of the theatre. This led many to it being representing the symbols of the [National Flag](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_488_2004-12-18.html)’s crescent moon and five stars (Image Credit: [Courtesy of the National Museum of Singapore, National Heritage Board](https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1190128){:target="_blank"}) |
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-parks-theatre-2.jpg)|
| The National Theatre was built to commemorate Singapore's achievement of self-government in 1959. It was also known as the “People’s Theatre” as members of the public had contributed towards the theatre’s building fund through various fundraising activities including the "A-Dollar-A-Brick" campaign.

| During its years of operation between 1963 and 1984, the National Theatre was the venue of many important events including the annual National Day rallies from 1966 to 1982. It was also used for performances and concerts featuring famous artistes and performing groups such as the Louis Armstrong Jazz Band, the Duke Ellington Orchestra, the NHK Symphony Orchestra, the Bee Gees, the Walker Brothers and the Yardbirds (shown above).(Image Credit: [Courtesy of the National Museum of Singapore, National Heritage Board](https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1401986){:target="_blank"}) |

##### **Van Kleef Aquarium**

The Van Kleef Aquarium was Singapore’s first public aquarium. Located at the foot of Fort Canning Hill, the aquarium was opened in 1955. It was a prominent landmark and a popular place of interest for Singaporeans and tourists alike. The aquarium underwent a series of revamps and was closed for good in 1996 with the building structure demolished in 1998.

| The Van Kleef Aquarium took its name from a Dutch businessman, Karl Willem Benjamin van Kleef, who lived in Singapore from the late 19th to the early 20th century. When he died in 1930, he bequeathed the net proceeds of his estates, valued at around $160,000, to the municipal government for the “embellishment of the town”. In the end, after much discussions and delays, the municipal government decided to build an aquarium on the western slopes of Fort Canning Hill between Tank Road and [River Valley](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-08-02_161313.html) Road beside King George V Park.

| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-parks-aqua-2-1.jpg)|
| Construction of the aquarium begun in 1940 but was derailed by the Japanese Occupation (1942–1945) and the subsequent post-war reconstruction works. It was eventually completed in September 1955 after works restarted in 1953. The aquarium was fully air-conditioned, had its own water supply, and housed nearly 6,500 fishes of more than 180 varieties. Admission to the aquarium was 30 cents for adults and 20 cents for children.

| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-parks-aqua-3-1.jpg)|
| The aquarium was a success from the start. Within the first three months of opening, 150,000 people had visited the attraction. By the 1960s, it was regarded as one of the best aquariums in Southeast Asia. The aquarium was also visited by prominent foreign leaders including the wife of Deng Xiaoping in 1978.

| However, the popularity of the aquarium began to decline following the opening of new attractions such as the [Singapore Zoo](http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_403_2005-01-19.html), the [Jurong Bird Park](http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_444_2004-12-16.html) and the [Underwater World](http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1855_2011-11-11.html). In May 1991, the aquarium closed its doors. Subsequently, the aquarium was reopened as World of Aquarium and Fort Canning Aquarium in October 1991 and 1993 respectively. But both endeavours were short-lived and the aquarium closed its doors for the final time in 1996. The building was then demolished in 1998.

##### **Swimming Pools**

Fort Canning Hill was once the site of two swimming pools. The first was the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) swimming pool, while the second was the River Valley Swimming Complex. Opened in 1919 and 1956 respectively, the two pools provided swimming

| The YMCA swimming pool on Fort Canning Hill was located off Fort Canning Rise near today's Fort Canning Centre. Opened in 1919, it was originally a salt water tank. The pool was [36 metres long](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19200310-1.2.66) and had a spring board, a diving stage, a freshwater bath and dressing sheds.

| Before the swimming pool ceased operations after the outbreak of the Second World War in Malaya and Singapore in 1941, it was regularly used by YMCA to conduct swimming lessons for its members. It was also the venue for swimming events such as the annual Swimming Carnival. Started in 1920, the event was a swim meet for clubs and schools in Singapore.

| The River Valley Swimming Complex was the other swimming pool that was once located in Fort Canning Hill. Situated between Van Kleef Aquarium and King George V Park, it was built by the Singapore City Council to provide a recreational outlet for the residents staying in the Chinatown area. The pool, which cost a whopping half a million dollars, was considered [a "sister" pool](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singstandard19570124-1.2.188) to Farrer Park Swimming Pool. Like the latter, it had two pools, one for advanced swimmers and another for children and beginners. Furthermore, it also had a diving stage.

| The River Valley Swimming Complex started operations in 1959. It was very popular and was used to hold many swimming events and activities including YMCA's swimming lessons for children and Pesta Sukan water events. However, from the 1970s, the swimming complex's visitorship started to decline as residents moved away from the city area before it was evenutally closed in 2003.

When my father was a primary school student, his teachers had often brought his school to visit the Van Kleef Aquarium as it was in close proximity to his school...[He also] went to this aquarium regularly, as he had a special liking for animals, such as fishes and other marine species. The aquarium housed many fascinating sea creatures, such as piranhas, crocodiles, electric eels and various exotic fishes from all over the world...According to [him], there were also park events and parties at the greenery outside the aquarium. Families with young children frequented the aquarium to view the colourful marine exhibits. My father had explained that he always looked forward to the visit and found each trip interesting and rewarding. It was especially delightful to see marine life in the flesh because there were hardly any interesting documentaries in the 1970s, there were no colour television sets and of course, no internet or YouTube at that time. My father said that he had been quite sad when the government decided to demolish the Van Kleef Aquarium in 1998...many Singaporeans would forget about this important tourist attraction of the past and we have lost a fraction of our national history. In fact, I would not have even known about it and its significance to Singapore if not for my father’s sharing. It is truly a pity that people in our generation did not even have a chance to know about this aquarium.
