The Fort Canning Hill we know today is more than a hilltop park with nine historical gardens. It is also a gateway to the history of Singapore as well as a venue for celebrations and recreational activities.

### **Becoming Today's Fort Canning Hill**

The transformation of Fort Canning Hill into today's multi-faceted location was due to the introduction of the Civic District Master Plan. Introduced in 1988, it turned the expansive, sprawling lawns of the hill into a venue for history as well as concerts, theatre productions and celebratory festivals.

| Following the release of the 1986 Conservation Master Plan, A [Master Plan for the Civic and Cultural District](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/detail/33484f58-3dc7-42c7-bbbe-624f02b8a484.aspx) was prepared in 1988 to provide guidance for the revitalisation of the historic area that housed the most important government buildings from the colonial era such as the Supreme Court and City Hall. Bounded by the Singapore River, Clemenceau Avenue, Orchard Road, Bras Basah Road and Esplanade Park as shown in the plan above, this 105-hectare area also include Fort Canning Hill.

| The comprehensive land use review was to bring out the distinctive historical qualities of the area by enhancing the Civic and Cultural District's relationship with adjacent areas such as Orchard Road, Marina Bay and the Singapore River. It also aimed to revitalise the area by not only conserving the historical buildings found there, but also turning it into a place of culture and heritage. To do so, key cultural amenities were built up in the district over time, including several public museums housed within historic buildings such as the Singapore Art Museum, and modern cultural icons like the Esplanade Theatres. Fort Canning Hill, on the other hand, became a public venue that showcases the nation's history and for performances and events.

| One of the key events that was held on Fort Canning Hill was the "From Singapore to Singaporean: The Bicentennial Experience" showcase at Fort Canning Centre. Launched in 2019, this year-long event was the centrepiece of Singapore's bicentennial celebrations that tells the history of Singapore before and after the arrival of the British in 1819. The showcase features a comprehensive gallery that included an indoor cinematic journey called "Time Traveller", which begins with the story of the country's evolution in the 500 years before the arrival of the British in 1819, and an outdoor exploratory trail called "Pathfinder", which features eight interactive pavilions and installations.

### **The Nine Gardens of Fort Canning Park**

Today, Fort Canning Hill continues to be a place of learning and celebration. Following an enhancement to restore the rich history of the hill, the Fort Canning Park now has nine historical gardens - the Pancur Larangan, Artisan’s Garden, Sang Nila Utama Garden, Jubilee Park, Raffles Garden, First Botanic Garden, Farquhar Garden, Spice Garden and Armenian Street Park. Built between 2018 and 2019 to commemorate Singapore’s bicentennial, these gardens are to give visitors a glimpse of the island’s past through nature and archaeological discoveries.

| **Sang Nila Utama Garden -** Named after the first king of early Singapore, Sang Nila Utama Garden re-imagines the Southeast Asian gardens of the 14th century. The garden has features typical of these early gardens such as a symmetrical layout, Javanese split gates to denote the entrance into its different zones or realms, reflective pools and statues of frogs, fishes and ducks. Ornamental and perfume plants ranging from Magnolias and Ixoras to Gardenias and Vallaris are also planted there to reflect their significance in ancient Javanese culture.

| **Pancur Lanrangan -** Comprising a water feature and stone murals, this garden is named after the "Forbidden Spring" (or "Pancur Lanrangan"). Believed to be used by the women of the royal household for bathing, the objective of this garden is to create a focal point to depict the significance of water to the Fort Canning site in the past.

| **Artisan's Garden -** Located at one of the sites where the archaeological digs of Fort Canning Hill was carried out, this garden showcases some of the porcelain, earthware and stoneware that were uncovered since the 1980s. It also has spaces for its visitors to learn about the archaeological excavations and their findings.

| **Raffles Garden -** Located at the foot of Raffles House, this garden is named after Sir Stamford Raffles. It showcases the diverse plant species that he encountered in Southeast Asia. Other than being an administrator, Raffles was also a keen naturalist and this garden recognised this side of him by featuring plants that he encountered in or introduced to Singapore, as well as those named after him or the naturalists he worked with. Some of the plants that can be found in this garden include Raffles' Pitcher Plant, Scorpion Orchid, Tandok-tandok, Kock's Bauhinia, Rose Myrtle, Sea Holly and Palas.

| **Farquhar Garden -** The Farquhar Garden is named after Major-General William Farquhar, the first British Resident and Commandant of Singapore. As a keen naturalist, Farquhar commissioned and compiled natural history drawings of the wildlife he encountered in the Malay Peninsula. In this garden, visitors can explore these drawings as it contains a gallery containing watercolour paintings from the William Farquhaur Collection of Natural History Drawings. The featured drawings there feature plants that were important in the early agronomy of Singapore such as Gambier, Coffee, Sugarcane, Taro, Screwpine and Common Red-stemmed Fig. (Image Credit: [Gilman Collection, Museum Purchase, 2005](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:-Botanical_Gardens,_Calcutta-_MET_DP147416.jpg){:target="_blank"}) |

| **Spice Garden -** In 1819, Raffles started a spice plantation at Fort Canning which proved successful and later inspired Singapore's first botanical garden. This Spice Garden is to recognise this endeavour. Comprises three zones including a Spice Gallery. It features more than 180 varieties of plants, such as spice trees and herbs.

| **First Botanic Garden -** To mark the existence of the original and Singapore’s first botanic garden on eastern slope the hill, this garden will showcase plant spices that were introduced to Singapore between the 1820s and 1840s such as clove and nutmeg. Trees and shrubs are also planted along Hill Street, Victoria Street, Bras Basah Road, Handy Road and Canning Rise, forming the boundaries of the original Botanic Garden.

| **Armenian Street Park -** This park connects Fort Canning Park, Bras Basah, Bugis, and the Civic District together to form an expanded arts, cultural and heritage precinct. It showcases plants in mobile planter boxes that represent the Peranakan food and culture. These include Jasmine, Champaca, the Chinese Rose and the Fingered Citron. The street park also contains sculptures and buildings related to the Armenian community. One of them is the Vanda Miss Joaqium Sculpture. Contributed by the Armenian Community and designed by the Armenian sculptor Artush Papoyan, it was unveiled in 2019 by Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to commemorate Vanda Miss Joaqium, the national flower of Singapore.

The area used to be called “King George the Fifth Jubilee Park”, named to mark the 1935 silver jubilee of King George the Fifth and Queen Mary.
