Fort Canning Hill is a popular park and cultural center in Singapore. It has a rich history that dates back to the 14th century when it served as the palatial home of Malay Kings. Later, the hill became a British military base and a site where many key historic events had taken place, including the establishment of the Botanic Gardens and Lieutenant-General Arthur Percivalâ€™s decision to surrender to the Japanese.

To gain a deeper appreciation for Fort Canning Hill's rich history and vibrant present, we must move beyond its physical structures and explore the wealth of resources we have in the National Library and National Archives, including vintage photographs, paintings, postcards, maps, and personal recollections.
