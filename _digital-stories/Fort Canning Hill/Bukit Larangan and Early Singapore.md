Before the British arrival in 1819, Singapore already had a settlement with a history that stretches back to the 14th century. This early settlement was not fictional as it was captured in historical text and maps.

### **Early Singapore in Maps**

Singapore's history during the pre-colonial period can be told through historical maps of the region. Hand-drawn, painted or printed by European and Asian cartographers as well as explorers who traversed Southeast Asia by ship in search of spices such as cloves, pepper and cinnamon, they are among the earliest material evidence of our past.

|This 1561 map, titled *India Tercera Nuova Tavola*, is one of the first early modern maps of Southeast Asia and the oldest in the National Library of Singapore’s map collection. The map makes reference to a “Cinca Pula” near the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula which scholars believe refers to the Island of Singapore. Created by the Italian cartographer Girolamo Ruscelli, the map, which is slightly smaller than a sheet of A4 paper, is made up of two sheets of paper seamed together. It is drawn at a time when European traders were exploring new routes to the East of India, including the Spice Islands in Southeast Asia.

|This 1604 map on the Straits of Singapore is part of a larger [work]( https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/detail/b44dd395-4a9a-4394-a9bf-4b7745a8eb74.aspx) by Manuel Godinho de Erédia, a Melaka-born half-Portuguese half-Bugis naval commander. The map is significant in that Singapore Island is referred to as “Sincapura” and locations such as Blakang Mati (now Sentosa), Tanjong Rhu, Sungei Bedok, Tanah Merah, Tanjong Rusa, and Selat Tebrau were shown. Furthermore, the name “Xabandaria” is indicated near the west of Tanjong Rhu, meaning the presence of a “Shahbandar” or harbour master’s compound on the island.

| This so-called "Mao Kun map" is part of a series of maps published in the late-Ming Dynasty military encyclopedia *Wu Bei Zhi* (1628). is believed to be based on the naval expeditions of the early 15th-century Ming admiral, Zheng He, who made several voyages from China to Southeast Asia and across the Indian Ocean. The pages shown here depict the return route between Melaka and China through the Strait of Singapore. The name "Temasek" (淡马锡), is marked on a hill on the right page, whereas Melaka (满剌加) is labelled at the top left of the left page.

|Printed in 1607, this is a schematic map of the Luso-Dutch naval confrontation that took place between 6 and 11 October 1603, in the Johor River (Rio Batusabar) near Pedra Branca (Pedro Blanca). Drawn with the east orientated to the top, the map is produced by Flemish goldsmith, engraver and publisher Theodore de Bry (1528–98). In the map, Singapore is spelt “Sinca Pora” and it is one of the earliest representations of the island’s coastline. Furthermore, the map shows the Johor Fleet (allies of the Dutch) is shown waiting at a shoal off the eastern coast of Singapore. As a whole, the map is significant for depicting the battle that illustrates the strategic importance of the Singapore Strait as a waterway connecting the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea.

|This 1654 hand-drawn Dutch chart that shows the Singapore Strait which is spelt “Straat Sincapura”. In the map, Singapore is represented by an elongated island called “Lang Eylant” or “Long Island”. However, the island is not completely drawn at the northern part, perhaps reflecting the cartographer’s lack of knowledge of the area. To the south of the strait, a large landmass can be seen. It has a phrase (“gebrooken eilanden”) stating that to the southern side of the Singapore Strait are a collection of islands. The chart, with its soundings and compass-rose lines, also identifies two navigational landmarks in the Singapore Strait: Johor Hill and the twin peaks of Bintan, both of which are highlighted in black ink.

|Jacques Nicolas Bellin (1703–72) was a French hydrographer who created maps for several key publications in the 18th century. On this 1755 map, Bellin depicts Singapore as an elongated island, calling it “Pulo or Isle Panjang” which means “Long Island” in Malay. Furthermore, he also indicates that the “Vieux Detroit de Sincapour” (or “Strait of Singapore”) includes the water channel that separates Singapore Island from the Malay Peninsula. Today, this strip of water is known as the Johor or Tebrau Strait.

### **Forbidden Hill**

The island of pre-colonial Singapore was referred to as "Danmaxi" or "Temasek" (meaning "place surrounded by the sea") in Chinese historical text. It was also known as "Singapura" (meaning "Lion City") after [Sang Nila Utama](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_93_2005-01-26.html) established a settlement there around 1299. Under his leadership and his descendants, namely Seri Wikrama Wira, Seri Rana Wikrama, Seri Maharaja and Iskandar Shah, this kingdom of Singapura thrived as a sea-port with a palace perched on Fort Canning Hill, which was then known as "Bukit Larangan" or the "Forbidden Hill". But it came to an end after it was invaded by the Majapahit Empire in 1398.

His link to the pre-1819 history of Singapore is his founding of a settlement called Singapura on the island Temasek around 1299.

The prince immediately proposed to visit them…But as they were passing over, they were caught in a severe storm, and the vessels began to leak, and the crews were unable, after repeated exertions, to throw out the water. They were accordingly compelled to throw overboard the greater part of the baggage in the vessel…The water nevertheless continued to gain ground, and every thing was thrown overboard till nothing now remained except the diadem…The prince ordered the diadem to be thrown overboard, the storm ceased and the vessel rose in the water, and the rowers pulled her ashore, and Sang Nila Utama with his attendants, immediately landed on the sands, and went to amuse themselves on the plain near the mouth of the river of Tamasek. There they saw an animal extremely swift and beautiful, its body of a red colour, it head black and its breast white, extremely agile, and of great strength, and its size a little larger than a he-goat. When it saw a great many people, it went towards the island and disappeared. Sang Nila Utiama enquired what animal was this, but none could them, till he enquired Damang Lebar Dawn, who informed him that the histories of ancient time, the sangha or lion was described in the same manner as this animal appeared. This is a fine place which contains so fierce and powerful an animal. Then Sang Nila Utama directed Indra B’hupala to go and inform his mother-in-law, that he should not return…and thus Sang Nila Utama settled the country of Tamasak, named it Singhapura, and reigned over it, and was panegyrized by Bat’h, who gave him the name of Sri Tri-buana."</span>

### **Early Singapore In Artifacts**

Artifacts can provide some physical evidence for whether a site was settled and how long it might have been in use prior to abandonment, and the information can test or complement the known textual evidence. The existing [open air museum of the 1988 Fort Canning excavation site](https://www.roots.gov.sg/places/places-landing/Places/surveyed-sites/Archaeological-Excavation-Site-at-Fort-Canning-Park) (FTC) which is open daily to visitors suggests that Fort Canning Hill area was part of a larger 14th century settlement in Singapore which includes the parts of the Civic District as well as the banks of the Singapore River.

It is upon the inner surface of the stone that the inscription is engraved. The workmanship is far ruder than any thing of the time that I have seen in Java or India; and the writing, perhaps from time, in some degree but more from the natural decomposition of rock, so much obliterated as to be quite illegible as a composition. Here and there, however, a few letters seem distinct enough. The character is rather round than square. It is probably the Pali, or religious character used by the followers of Buddha, and of which abundant examples are to be found in Java and Sumatra; while no monuments exist in these countries in their respective vernacular alphabets."</span>

| The [Singapore Stone](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_43_2005-01-26.html) is also captured in a [1825](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/fb6e9ffb-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad) map which shows the original location of the ancient relic at "Rocky Point" near the present-day Fullerton Hotel. Originally about 3 meters high and 3 meters wide and said to contain about 50 lines of inscriptions, it was blown up in 1843 under the orders of the settlement engineer Captain Stevenson to provide space for Fort Fullerton and its living quarters. Fragments of the stone were sent to Kolkata in India in 1848 for study, with the remaining fragment remaining in Singapore. Scholars believed that the ancient script was likely to be either in Old Javanese (Kawi) or Sanskrit and might date to the 11th\-14th centuries (see Miksic [1985](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=4080784): 13 and Sinclair [2019](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=204343146): 49-51).

One of the excavation pits located near Keramat [Iskandar Shah](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1540_2009-07-06.html) (KIS) yielded two significant objects made of Chinese porcelain: a compass (shown above) and a porcelain pillow which depicted theatrical images.

| Fort Canning was excavated several times after 1984, usually prior to planned development. This blue glass bead was found at the Fort Canning Spice Gardens excavation during the construction of a wheelchair ramp and is suspected to be from a 14th century yielding layer. At a nearby site located 25 meters to the west, 159 glass beads were found during an archaeological excavation at Fort Canning (FTC) in 1988. Other artifacts, such as irregularly shaped globules (blobs), shards of thin-walled containers, beads, and bangle fragments were also found. Based on the irregular shaped globules, the site was suspected to be a glass workshop. It was thought that the glass was imported.

| This green porcelain bowl is a unique example excavated at the Fort Canning Spice Gardens in 2010 and is likely to be a product of the Guangdong Xicun kiln area. The designs located within the bowl appear to be “variations on the eight treasures.” Many Chinese ceramics dating to the late Song and Yuan dynasties were found in Fort Canning. Some ceramics on the Hill were of a finer quality that lends merit to the idea that the Hill may have been an area for elites in the 14th century, and that Singapore was a trading hub in an ancient maritime trading network; a part of the [Silk Road of the Sea](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=200123868).

Fragments of this are in great abundance. In the same situation have been found Chinese brass coins of the tenth and eleventh centuries. The earliest is of the Emperor Ching chung, of the dynasty of Sung-chao, who died in the year 967. Another is of the reign of Jin-chung of the same dynasty, who died in 1067; and a third of Shin-chung, his successor, who died in 1085. The discovery of these coins affords some confirmation of the relations which fix the establishment of the Malays at Singapore, in the twelfth century. It should be remarked, in reference to this subject, that the coins of China were in circulation among all the nations of the India islands before they adopted the Mohammedan religion, or had any intercourse with Europeans. They are dug up in numbers in Java, and are still the only money used by the uncovered natives of Bali."</span>
