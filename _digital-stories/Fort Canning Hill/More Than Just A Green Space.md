The Fort Canning Hill we know today is more than a hilltop park with nine historical gardens, but also a historical gateway as well as a venue for celebrations and recreational activities. This manifestation was due to the inclusion of Fort Canning Hill in the Museum Planning Area of the 1988 Civic District Master Plan.
