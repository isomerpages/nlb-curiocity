The Fort Canning Hill we know today is more than a hilltop park with nine historical gardens. It is also a gateway to the history of Singapore as well as a venue for celebrations and recreational activities. This multi-faceted function of Fort Canning Hill was due to the introduction of the Civic District Master Plan in 1988.
