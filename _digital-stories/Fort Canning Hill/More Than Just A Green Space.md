The Fort Canning Hill we know today is more than a hilltop park with nine historical gardens. It is also a gateway to the history of Singapore as well as a venue for celebrations and recreational activities.

**The Nine Gardens of Fort Canning Park**

Today, Fort Canning Park features nine historical gardens - the Pancur Larangan, Artisan’s Garden, Sang Nila Utama Garden, Jubilee Park, Raffles Garden, First Botanic Garden, Farquhar Garden, Spice Garden and Armenian Street Park. Built between 2018 and 2019 to commemorate Singapore’s bicentennial, these gardens are to give visitors a glimpse of the island’s past through nature and archaeological discoveries.

**Sang Nila Utama Garden**

Named after the first king of early Singapore, Sang Nila Utama Garden reimagines the Southeast Asian gardens of the 14th century. The garden has features typical of these early gardens such as a symmetrical layout, Javanese split gates to denote the entrance into its different zones or realms, reflective pools and statues of frogs, fishes and ducks. Ornamental and perfume plants ranging from Magnolias and Ixoras to Gardenias and Vallaris are also planted there to reflect their significance in ancient Javanese culture.

**Pancur Lanrangan**

Comprising a water feature and stone murals, this garden is named after the "Forbidden Spring" (or "Pancur Lanrangan"). Believed to be used by the women of the royal household for bathing, the objective of this garden is to create a focal point to depict the significance of water to the Fort Canning site in the past.

**Artisan's Garden**
Located at one of the sites where the archaeological digs of Fort Canning Hill was carried out, this garden showcases some of the porcelain, earthware and stoneware that were uncovered since the 1980s. It also has spaces for its visitors to learn about the archaeological excavations and their findings.

**Raffles Garden**

Located at the foot of Raffles House, this garden is named after Sir Stamford Raffles. It showcases the diverse plant species that he encountered in Southeast Asia. Other than being an administrator, Raffles was also a keen naturalist and this garden recognised this side of him by featuring plants that he encountered in or introduced to Singapore, as well as those named after him or the naturalists he worked with. Some of the plants that can be found in this garden include Raffles' Pitcher Plant, Scorpion Orchid, Tandok-tandok, Kock's Bauhinia, Rose Myrtle, Sea Holly and Palas.

**Farquhar Garden**

The Farquhar Garden is named after Major-General William Farquhar, the first British Resident and Commandant of Singapore. As a keen naturalist, Farquhar commissioned and compiled natural history drawings of the wildlife he encountered in the Malay Peninsula. In this garden, visitors can explore these drawings as it contains a gallery containing watercolour paintings from the William Farquhaur Collection of Natural History Drawings. The featured drawings there feature plants that were important in the early agronomy of Singapore such as Gambier, Coffee, Sugarcane, Taro, Screwpine and Common Red-stemmed Fig.

**Spice Garden**
In 1819, Raffles started a spice plantation at Fort Canning which proved successful and later inspired Singapore's first botanical garden. This Spice Garden is to recognise this endeavour. Comprises three zones including a Spice Gallery. It features more than 180 varieties of plants, such as spice trees and herbs.

**First Botanic Garden**

To mark the existence of the original and Singapore’s first botanic garden on eastern slope the hill, this garden will showcase plant spices that were introduced to Singapore between the 1820s and 1840s such as clove and nutmeg. Trees and shrubs are also planted along Hill Street, Victoria Street, Bras Basah Road, Handy Road and Canning Rise, forming the boundaries of the original Botanic Garden.

**Armenian Street Park**

This park connects Fort Canning Park, Bras Basah, Bugis, and the Civic District together to form an expanded arts, cultural and heritage precinct. It showcases plants in mobile planter boxes that represent the Peranakan food and culture. These include Jasmine, Champaca, the Chinese Rose and the Fingered Citron. The street park also contains sculptures and buildings related to the Armenian community. One of them is the Vanda Miss Joaqium Sculpture. Contributed by the Armenian Community and designed by the Armenian sculptor Artush Papoyan, it was unveiled in 2019 by Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to commemorate Vanda Miss Joaqium, the national flower of Singapore.

**Jubilee Park**  

Sited within the park at the junction of River Valley Road and [Clemenceau Avenue](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_803_2004-12-16.html), Jubilee Park will feature play areas for children, cafes and an outdoor theatre space and an event lawn for art installations, artists markets and performances.39 The area used to be called “King George the Fifth Jubilee Park”, named to mark the 1935 silver jubilee of King George the Fifth and Queen Mary.

**Heritage Gallery**  

A new heritage gallery covering the history and natural history of the Fort Canning area since the 14th to the 19th and 20th centuries will be opened at the Fort Canning Centre. The highlight of the gallery includes artefacts such as jewellery, ceramics and coins dug up from various archaeological excavations at the Fort Canning site.
  
New and permanent features will be introduced to Fort Canning Park by the National Parks Board (NParks) as part of the agency’s ongoing efforts to liven up the site that will coincide with the bicentennial celebrations. Plans include recreating three historical gardens, a new heritage gallery and a creative reproduction of an ancient spring. These new features will pay homage to the historical landscapes of the past

**Civic District Master Plan**

This multi-faceted function of Fort Canning Hill was due to the introduction of the Civic District Master Plan in 1988.
