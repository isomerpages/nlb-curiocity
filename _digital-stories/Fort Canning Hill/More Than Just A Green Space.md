The Fort Canning Hill we know today is more than a hilltop park with nine historical gardens. It is also a gateway to the history of Singapore as well as a venue for celebrations and recreational activities. This multi-faceted function of Fort Canning Hill was due to the introduction of the Civic District Master Plan in 1988.

**The Nine Gardens of Fort Canning Park**

Today, Fort Canning Park features nine historical gardens - the Pancur Larangan, Artisan’s Garden, Sang Nila Utama Garden, Jubilee Park, Raffles Garden, First Botanic Garden, Farquhar Garden, Spice Garden and Armenian Street Park. Built between 2018 and 2019 to commemorate Singapore’s bicentennial, these gardens are to give visitors a glimpse of the island’s past through nature and archaeological discoveries.

**Sang Nila Utama Garden**

**Pancur Lanrangan**
This garden aims to recreate the Pancur Lanrangan (or the "Forbidden Spring"). A water feature and stone murals will also be erected on the western part of the hill. The spot is likely where a forbidden spring, where royal women once bathed, used to be located. The objective of the spring structure is to create a focal point to depict the significance of water to the Fort Canning site in the past.

The Royal Garden  
Facing Stamford Road, the Royal Garden will feature plants such as jackfruit and rambutan. These were previously observed by [John Crawfurd](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_188_2005-01-20.html), the second British resident in Singapore, on the hill in 1822 as evidence of a 14th century palace garden.

**First Botanic Garden**
The original and Singapore’s first botanic garden, which Sir Stamford Raffles had established on the eastern slope of the hill in 1822 will be recreated in Armenian Street. It will showcase plant spices such as clove and nutmeg introduced to Singapore between the 1820s and 1840s. Trees and shrubs will also be planted along [Hill Street](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_269_2005-01-19.html), Victoria Street, [Bras Basah Road](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_227_2005-01-25.html), Handy Road and Canning Rise, forming the boundaries of the original Botanic Garden.

**Armenian Street Park**
  
**Jubilee Park**  
Sited within the park at the junction of River Valley Road and [Clemenceau Avenue](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_803_2004-12-16.html), Jubilee Park will feature play areas for children, cafes and an outdoor theatre space and an event lawn for art installations, artists markets and performances.39 The area used to be called “King George the Fifth Jubilee Park”, named to mark the 1935 silver jubilee of King George the Fifth and Queen Mary.

**Heritage Gallery**  
A new heritage gallery covering the history and natural history of the Fort Canning area since the 14th to the 19th and 20th centuries will be opened at the Fort Canning Centre. The highlight of the gallery includes artefacts such as jewellery, ceramics and coins dug up from various archaeological excavations at the Fort Canning site.
  
New and permanent features will be introduced to Fort Canning Park by the National Parks Board (NParks) as part of the agency’s ongoing efforts to liven up the site that will coincide with the bicentennial celebrations. Plans include recreating three historical gardens, a new heritage gallery and a creative reproduction of an ancient spring. These new features will pay homage to the historical landscapes of the past
