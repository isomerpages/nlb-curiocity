### **Schools of Bras Basah**

The close proximity of Bras Basah to the town centre and the various ethnic enclaves of Singapore has made it an ideal location for the establishment of schools during the colonial period. Started by town planners, missionaries and philanthropists, these early schools provide the children of the time a priceless place to learn and acquire knowledge regardless of gender, race and religion. Below is a selection of these schools.

|Raffles Institution is one of the oldest schools. Although its foundation stone was laid in 1823, its history stretches back to 1819 when Sir Stamford Raffles proposed the establishment of a premier learning institution. Initially known as Singapore Institution, it was renamed Raffles Institution in 1868, and it was originally located at Bras Basah Road. However, it later moved to Grange Road in the early 1970s and then Bishan where it remains today. Its former site is currently occupied by Raffles City Shopping Centre.

|Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) is the oldest Catholic girls’ school in Singapore. Founded in 1854 by the French sisters of the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus, the school was established at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Victoria Street (present site of CHIJMES). In December 1983, the school moved to a new site in Toa Payoh to make way for the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) headquarters. Following the move, its primary and secondary sections were renamed CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh) and CHIJ Secondary (Toa Payoh).

|Raffles Girls' School (RGS) started as a one-room department within Raffles Institution in 1844 before it was officially established in 1879 with 77 students. As the school expanded, it moved to a new premises in Queen Street in 1928 and became a full-fledged girls’ school. In 1959, the school moved again to Anderson Road before settling on its present Braddell Rise campus in 2019. Today, the school's former Bras Basah site is occupied by the Singapore Management University's School of Business.

|St Jospeh's Institution (SJI) was founded in 1852 by Father Jean-Marie Beurel of the Missions Étrangères de Paris (The Society of Foreign Missions of Paris). Before moving to its current location on Malcolm Road in 1988, it used to occupied the present site of the Singapore Art Museum along Bras Basah Road. This building was completed in 1867 and comprised a cluster of blocks featuring a classical style reminiscent of the European Renaissance. Today, this building is a national monument after it was gazetted on 14 February 1992. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/d569650e-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"})|

|Catholic High School (CHS) is one of Singapore’s highly regarded institutions. Although it was established as a Catholic institution, it enroled both Catholic and non-Catholic students. The school was founded in 1935 by French missionary Rev. Fr. Edward Becheras within the premises of the Church of St Peter and Paul at Queen Street. Today, CHS is located in Bishan after it moved out from Bras Basah in 1992.

Leaking, threatening also [to collapse]. One block had to be pulled down because it posed a serious threat to the safety of people. It was then an issue of whether to re-build on the existing site or move elsewhere. I am quite sure that the decision to move was part and parcel of the whole process of urban renewal. There must have been talk even then of expanding the business district. And that was quite a valuable piece of land. Even then, the town planners must have seen a point in our development when all the schools located in the city centre would have to move out. That actually has happened. RGS [Raffles Girls’ School), Consent of The Holy Jesus, Catholic High School [and] St Joseph’s Institution [have all moved out]. This must have been part of the whole process." </span>

### **Bookstores in Bras Basah**

Mention [Bras Basah Road](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_227_2005-01-25.html){:target="_blank"} to a Singaporean who lived through the nation-building years and “books, stationery and printing services” are among the words which may spring to mind. Back then, the road and those nearby including [North Bridge Road](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_880_2004-12-28.html){:target="_blank"} used to house shophouses famous for such services.

| The bookstores along Bras Basah Road thrived as a popular haunt for students searching for second-hand textbooks especially towards the end of the year-end school holidays.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">"As I said society itself was not really that affluent, it was common to go around to buy at the second-hand book shops. Once you have finished your schooling this year, you go to the second-hand book shop in Bras Basah Road…On the left-hand side opposite what used to be the YMCA Tennis Court and across Bencoolen Street there were also three or four, where books, second-hand books were sold…when it came to around December before schools reopen in January, everybody would rush to go and get the books…depending on the price and the condition, you could bargain over the price, of course the few cents, whereas the other costs three or four times as much. So those who could not afford better type one would take even tatted ones…basic thing was they all contained the same material in different conditions of wear and year. So every year, you finished with your book for this year, unless you have children who are going to come in the next year or two, you keep them at home rather than go and sell and re-buy…I think they are all printed by the Malaya Publishing House or so, the premier publishing house in those days."</span>

| Known as the "Grand Dame of Bookstores", MPH began as Amelia Bishop Press in 1890. Originally, it was located in a shophouse at the junction of Selegie Road and Sophia Road. It then moved to Raffles Place in 1893 before ending up at the three-storey red-brick and plaster Vanguard building at the junction of Armenian Street and Stamford Road in 1908. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/d3e8278f-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"})|

#### **The "Big Three" of Local Chinese Bookstores**

Besides English bookstores, Bras Basah also used to house many Chinese bookstores. Among them, there were three that were considered as the most influential. Namely Shanghai Book Company, World Book Company and Nanyang Book Company, they played an important role in shaping Singapore's book industry.

| The [POPULAR bookstore](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1672_2010-06-16.html){:target="_blank"} that we know today was initially known as World Book Company. Set up by Chou Sing Chu in 1936, it was located on North Bridge Road, 

focusing on retailing Chinese books and stationery. Its business soon expanded into Malaysia and Indonesia but was disrupted by the outbreak of WWII. After the war, POPULAR resumed its expansion and quickly become a household name for students and parents in Singapore and overseas seeking affordable quality educational books and stationary. Today, its flagship store is located at Bras Basah Complex.

The Big Book, The World Book, Popular Book Store, Shanghai Book Store, United Publishing House, The Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Co, Nanyang Book Company etc were there. These companies were not strangers to me. As I was the Head of English Department in Gongshang Primary School then, every year I received numerous review copies of children’s books, assessment books, model compositions, etc from these various publishers and book companies. The most popular was the Popular Book Store as it was the biggest bilingual and most attractive store there. Many of my sons’ reference and story books were from there. One of the best buys was a set of Children’s Encyclopaedia which I still have today...Today the Popular Book Store not only sell Chinese and English books, school text and assessment books, stationery etc, it also sells music CDs, DVDs, computer printers, games, and other software." </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">Xinyao (新谣) is a genre of music that typically refers to Mandarin ballads composed, written and performed by youths in Singapore. Started in the late 1970s, xinyao was at its peak in the 1980s and propelled many local singers and singer-songwriters to stardom, several of whom successfully transitioned to the commercial sector. Big names often associated with the xinyao movement include Eric Moo (巫启贤), Billy Koh (许环良), Liang Wern Fook (梁文福) and Roy Loi (黎沸挥).</span>

### **The National Museum and National Library**

Besides the schools and the bookstores, Bras Basah was and continues to be a place for knowledge. This is largely because of the presence of both the National Library and National Museum in the district since the mid-1800s. 

##### **The National Museum**

With its wide facade and large dome, the [National Museum of Singapore](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2015-08-31_132917.html){:target="_blank"} has been a prominent landmark on Stamford Road for over a century. Gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992, it is Singapore’s oldest existing museum, currently devoted to the general history of Singapore.

|[![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/bb-museum-1.jpg)](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/d5418d0c-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"} |
| The establishment of a museum was first mooted in 1823, when Sir Stamford Raffles proposed founding a college in Singapore. However, it was not realised until 1849. Set up within the Singapore Library, it was located together with the library in the premises of the Singapore Institution (today's Raffles Institution) (shown above) before moving to the Town Hall (present-day Victoria Theatre) in 1862. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/d5418d0c-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

|[![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/bb-museum-2.jpg)](https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1189977){:target="_blank"}|
| In 1874, the museum and the Singapore Library were combined to form the Raffles Library and Museum. However, it would take more than a decade before the new institution was moved to the museum's present building in 1887. Designed by Colonial Engineer Henry E. McCallum, it was built in a neo-Palladian style, characterised by a highly symmetrical facade, as well as the use of pediments above the windows, Doric columns and pilasters on the ground level and Ionic pilasters on the second level.

| Initially, the museum was positioned as repository of zoological specimens, documenting the natural history of Singapore and the region. Towards the end of the 1800s, it expanded its collection to  portraits, plans and photographs of old Singapore. After the museum was separated from the library and following Singapore's independence, it shifted its focus to reflect the nation’s culture and history.

##### **The National Library**

The [former National Library Building](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_661_2004-12-27.html) was located at 91 Stamford Road. It was officially opened on 12 November 1960. Between 1887 and 1960, the National Library previously occupied the western wing of the Raffles Museum (now the National Museum of Singapore) at Stamford Road.

| The building was designed by the Public Works Department architect, Lionel Bintley while the project architect was Tio Seng Chin. The completed library had a reinforced concrete framed structure and was easily recognised for its iconic red brick walls which was a reflection of the epoch of British architecture in the 1950s.

| The total floor area of the new building was 101,500 sq ft. The ground floor comprised the exhibition hall, adult lending library, children’s library, children’s activities room and lecture hall. The mezzanine floor, on the other hand, housed administrative offices and a stack area, while the first floor held the reference library, microfilm reading room and a conference room.

| In 1998, it was announced that the National Library on Stamford Road would be demolished to make way for the Singapore Management University (SMU) and the construction of Fort Canning tunnel. Although there were calls to preserve the building, it was carried out. Today, the National Library in located in an ultra-modern building located on Victoria Street. However, the gates of the old library could still be found within the premises of SMU.

**Little Red Bricks**

Though the old National library was demolished almost 15 years ago in 2004, it will forever live on in the memories of the countless amount of Singaporeans that frequented it over the decades. Local animation studio Robot Playground has decided to take it one step further by immortalising the National Library in a 15-minute animated short titled “Little Red Bricks” that pays tribute to not only the building itself but the people as well through the the life and times of a boy and a girl. Watch the breathtaking video below.

To prevent the former library to fade away with its demolition, the National Library Board published *Moments In Time* (2004) to capture the memories of its users.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">"My memories of the National Library centre around the varied encounters and experiences that were inevitably the product of looking for information and books, while growing up in the 1980s and 1990s. I remember when I was in Secondary Two and had to do a project on science in sport - how there was only a single book in the library system which was located in the national reference library...I remember that it was there that I learned how to operate the microfiche machines, in search for newspaper reports on the Hock Lee Bus strikes; that when in Secondary Four, how my classmates and I did a project on creation and evolution and ended up chatting with girls from an assortment of schools while waiting in the photocopy queues. I remember how as a 17-year-old I discovered Jack Keroauc and Ken Kesey and an assortment of poets and writes on lonely Sunday afternoons - books that had lain unborrowed for years, on the shelves of the library and greedily calculated how many I could check out. These were the days before the Internet, before Borders or Kinokuniya and the National Library certainly expanded my horizons." </span>

#### **Truly, A Place For Books and Knowledge**

While the photo essay and memories above provide an insight on how Bras Basah thrived as a place for books and knowledge, it became even clearer if we were to plot some of these places on a map. See the story map below to understand what we meant.
