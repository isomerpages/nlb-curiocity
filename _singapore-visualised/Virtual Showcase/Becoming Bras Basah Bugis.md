### **In Need For Renewal**

Up till the 1970s, Bras Basah and its adjacent district, Bugis, were abuzz with activities, thanks to the schools, bookstores, cinemas, hawkers and nightlife activities there. But like other inner city areas, the two districts were in need for a renewal. Not only its streets were congested and overcrowded, their colonial era shophouses were in dilapidated condition. To address these issues, the government led by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) extended the urban renewal programme to the Bras Basah and Bugis area during the 1980s.

### **Revitalisation of Bras Basah and Bugis**

By the early 1990s, the Bras Basah and Bugis districts had developed a new shine but they were quieter and less vibrant than before. To rejuvenate the two areas, the URA decided to develop them together as a heritage, arts and learning enclave. Guided by the Rochor Development Guide Plan (DGP), which was released in 1993, buildings in the area ranging from former school grounds to cinemas and shophouses were turned into commercial developments as well as cultural and heritage spaces.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">Development Guide Plans (DGPs) are detailed short- to medium-term land-use plans completed between 1993 and 1998 as part of a comprehensive review of the Master Plan 1985. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the national land-use planning agency, divided Singapore into 55 planning areas and drew up a DGP for each of these areas. A blueprint of the living, working and leisure environment in Singapore, the 55 DGPs together formed the overall Master Plan 1998, which was gazetted on 22 January 1999. The URA released the first of its 55 DGPs in 1993. The final DGP was released in July 1998 for the Punggol area and included detailed plans for Punggol 21.</span>

### **Becoming Bras Basah.Bugis**

The revitalisation of Bras Basah and Bugis following the launch of the Rochor DGP has allowed the two districts to become the Bras Basah.Bugis (BBB) precinct of today. First announced after the release of the 2003 Master Plan, BBB is identified by the URA as a "treasure trove of cultural and architectural references" marked by its compelling blend of old and new architecture.

The ability of BBB to retains its architectural and cultural heritage has made itself unique compared to other precincts especially Orchard Road and the Downtown Core. This identity is further enhanced by the existence of renowned educational institutions and arts groups in BBB as it did in the past.

### **An Ode to Bras Basah**

Emeritus Professor and Professorial Fellow of the National University of Singapore Edwin Thumboo has been involved in Singapore’s literary developments since the 1950s. Over the course of his illustrious career which he picked up many awards including the Singapore Cultural Medallion and Singapore's Meritorious Service Medal, he has published five volumes of poetry. While many of these poems addressed national issues, some are dedicated to places in Singapore. One of these is "Bras Basah". It is a remarkable piece of place poem as Thumboo is about to vividly captured Bras Basah of the past in its entirety in just a few verse.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">Where the first Rendezvous brooded
<br>By a row of old shophouses, since sadly slain,
<br>A special road began. A point of colonial
<br>Confluence: Dhoby Ghaut, the YWCA with
<br>Manicured tennis lawns for memsahibs who
<br>Then took tea and scones. Across a Shell kiosk
<br>Where Papa parked his Austin Seven, then off
<br>To Hock Hoe’s for piston rods and Radex
<br>
<br>Think of the names: Dhoby Ghaut, Prinsep St,
<br>The three Cathays, a name the Lokes made
<br>Famous: resplendent building, our tallest then;
<br>Fantastic camera shop; and that popular Store
<br>Where Rudy’s wife, petite, temporarily demure,
<br>Quietly assessed her customers as she held her
<br>Intelligence above show-cases. Two doors away,
<br>Heng, increasingly called Mr, sold German cameras
<br>To Japanese sailors, was en route to a partnership.
<br>
<br>And the bookshops full of stuff: Penguin New 
<br>Writing to Palgrave’s G-Treasury; Q’s Oxford 
<br>Anthology, a blue spine among mouldy issues 
<br>Of The Wide World where imperial dreams, 
<br>The White man’s burden trudged across Asia and
<br>Africa, up Ruwenzori’s mist and moon, then down
<br>The Brahmaputra. Mainly first-hand accounts, 
<br>Direct, unshorn, marching against superstition.
<br>Plain narratives rising in majesty, in power, art.
<br>No cute theory of the Other. Only them natives.
<br>
<br>And the Rendezvous after school; affordable.
<br>The man with the mole, ladle in hand, presided,
<br>Holding the extra spoonful, balanced fate,deciding
<br>If he liked you. Two doors away Simon Ong’s
<br>Family shop of fishing tackle, Winchester torches,
<br>Knives of Solingen steel. Outside, a Woodsville tram,
<br>Full of St Andrew boys, swings around the corner,
<br>Tires squealing.
<br>
<br>Standing there, the world grew,
<br>Bit by bit, seemed different with each fresh vantage
<br>Shift in weather; hormonal stir, sweet unknowing;
<br>An ache that knew no words; a quickly passing mouth.
<br>As eyes caught more lit with sensuous guilt, when 
<br>Curves beneath Convent uniforms heaved and turned
<br>With the mind’s proposal, the rainbow’s ripening,
<br>As thoughts fingered image, each chance encounter.
<br>Experience became a word as Life cease to be simple.
