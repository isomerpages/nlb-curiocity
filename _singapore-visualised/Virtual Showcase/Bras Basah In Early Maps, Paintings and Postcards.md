### **Early Maps on Bras Basah**

Bras Basah is among the oldest districts in Singapore. Situated within the European part of [Sir Stamford Raffles’s](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_715_2004-12-15.html) 1822 plan for the town of Singapore or the [Raffles Town Plan](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_658_2005-01-07.html), it served as the suburb to the busy city centre which wrapped itself around [Commercial Square](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_864_2004-12-30.html) (now known as Raffles Place). Over the next two centuries, Bras Basah would grow spectacularly resulting in the establishments of schools, religious buildings and some of the finest colonial structures in Singapore.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">"The road was so-called because in the early days, wet rice was laid to dry here on the banks of the "fresh water stream" (now the Stamford Canal). Another version is that before the area before Bras Basah Road and Stamford was filled in, cargoes of rice were brought by boats into the lagoon and spread to dry on the road. One one occasion, high tides wet the rice."</span>

Created by immensely talented painters, one who stood up the most is John Turnbull Thomson as his paintings are said to have captured much of Singapore’s built landscape in the mid 1840s and its cultural diversity.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">John Turnbull Thomson was the Government Surveyor of the Straits Settlements from 1841 to 1853. He made a number of important contributions during his 12 years in Singapore, including the creation of maps of early Singapore, as well as the design and construction of several buildings and other public infrastructure on the island. A self-taught artist and prolific writer, Thomson’s collection of paintings, books and articles now serve as invaluable records of the architecture and life of early Singapore.</span>

### **Bras Basah in Postcards**

The first postcard in the Straits Settlements was issued in 1879. However, it was only until the late 1890s after the British postal authorities allowed privately printed postcards to be despatched at the same inexpensive postal rate as government issued ones that pictures began to appear on the otherwise blank postcards. A genre of picture postcards that quickly gained popularity was those that showed local views including the physical landscape of Singapore. Today these postcards, which can be found in the collections of the National Archives of Singapore and National Museum of Singapore, are able to provide us with an invaluable of the past.
