Bras Basah is one of the oldest districts in Singapore. With buildings both old and new lining manicured and landscaped streets as old as the island’s modern history, Bras Basah reflects Singapore’s unique identity as a multicultural society that thrives on its energetic future and vibrant past. 

To truly understand and feel Bras Basah’s past and present, we have to look past its built heritage and delve into resources such as old photographs, paintings, postcards, maps and memories. 

<span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">“Bras Basah Through The Years”</span> presents the district as documented in the resources and content from institutions such as the National Library Board, National Heritage Board and Urban Redevelopment Authority as well as those compiled or created by heritage bloggers, filmmakers and even YouTubers just to name a few.
