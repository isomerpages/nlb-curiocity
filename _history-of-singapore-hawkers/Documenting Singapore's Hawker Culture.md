### **Licensing Hawkers**

Following independence, the government tackled the hawker issue through measures like the 1966 Hawkers' Code, which introduced licensing regulations and restricted hawking in congested areas. Licensed hawkers were relocated to less busy sites, while a special squad conducted raids to remove illegal vendors, encouraging able-bodied individuals to seek alternative employment.

| Singapore's vibrant culinary scene has been thoughtfully chronicled over the decades through travel guides, food directories, cookbooks, and other publications. As early as colonial times, guides like *Willis’s Singapore Guide* (1936) highlighted popular spots to eat and unwind. For instance, Raffles Place, John Little, and Robinson’s were not only listed as shopping destinations, but also places with lounge cafes offering tea, coffee, ices, and alcoholic beverages in cool and relaxing atmosphere. The guide also spotlighted Oi Mee Hotel at Pasir Panjang for its excellent Chinese dinners and dedicated an entire chapter to the iconic Satai (Satay) Club, then located on Hoi How Road, near Beach Road. Complementing the text were photographs of street hawkers, showcasing a wide array of food offerings, including the much-loved durians.
