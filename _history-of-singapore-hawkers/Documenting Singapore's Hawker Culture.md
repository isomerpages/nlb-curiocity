### **Early Singapore Food Guides**

Singapore's culinary journey, from its early documentation in colonial travelogues to the rise of today's influential food blogs, reflects a deep and enduring passion for food. These publications, along with countless other forms of culinary expression, have helped shape and preserve Singapore's unique food culture, culminating in the prestigious UNESCO recognition of its hawker heritage.

| Singapore's vibrant culinary scene has been thoughtfully chronicled over the decades through travel guides, food directories, cookbooks, and other publications. As early as colonial times, guides like *Willis’s Singapore Guide* (1936) highlighted popular spots to eat and unwind. For instance, Raffles Place, John Little, and Robinson’s were not only listed as shopping destinations, but also places with lounge cafes offering tea, coffee, ices, and alcoholic beverages in cool and relaxing atmosphere. The guide also spotlighted Oi Mee Hotel at Pasir Panjang for its excellent Chinese dinners and dedicated an entire chapter to the iconic Satai (Satay) Club, then located on Hoi How Road, near Beach Road. Complementing the text were photographs of street hawkers, showcasing a wide array of food offerings, including the much-loved durians.

| The trend of showcasing dining spots across the island continued during the nation-building years, with the Singapore Tourist Association (now the Singapore Tourism Board) actively promoting both restaurant and hawker fare from various ethnic groups to locals and tourists alike in food directories such as Singapore Gourmet’s Guide and later Singapore: Our Gourmet World since the 1960s. Other than serving as valuable resources for culinary exploration, these guides also highlighted where to enjoy Chinese, Indian, Malay, Japanese, and European cuisines, while delving into the history of many featured dishes.
