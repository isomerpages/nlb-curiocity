During Singapore's colonial period and the early years of independence, the idea of enjoying a meal in clean hawker centres was unheard of. People usually ate by the roadside, often using dirty utensils in unhygienic conditions. The transformation into today’s hawker culture – where meals are enjoyed in centralised, clean, and organised spaces – came about through decades of effort and collaboration between the government and hawkers. This section explores this symbiotic relationship, highlighting the regulations, measures, and compromises made by both sides.

### **Early Hawkers**

As early as the mid-19th century, there were already many street hawkers making a living on the streets of Singapore. It was a popular job for the unemployed and unskilled because it required very little capital to start. In fact, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, many artisans and labourers who lost their jobs turned to hawking to help support their families. Even children took part, selling food, drinks, vegetables, poultry, and other items alongside their families in busy streets and intersections.

| Among the various types of hawkers, food sellers made up the largest group. With few eating places in the city, these vendors provided quick and affordable meals to labourers working at the docks and warehouses, as well as office workers. Many city dwellers, who didn’t cook at home, also relied on these hawkers. Other hawkers included small-scale farmers selling leftover crops, and street vendors commissioned by wholesalers to sell perishable goods like vegetables and fruits. Additionally, some hawkers sold everyday items like sandals and brooms, or offered services like barbering, shoe repair, and lock mending.

| Hawkers transported their goods in a variety of ways. Some walked through the streets carrying baskets on a shoulder pole or balancing trays on their heads. Others used barrows, bicycles, tricycles, or carts equipped with cooking tools. Soup noodle carts, for example, were designed with glass compartments to display ingredients and a cauldron with sections for soup and boiling water. Hawkers would sometimes set up at busy spots to attract more customers.

| In the suburbs, hawkers brought food and other essentials right to residents' doorsteps, adding convenience to daily life. These traveling vendors followed regular routes, and their customers were familiar with their schedules. To announce their arrival, hawkers often used sound makers like bamboo sticks or bells.

### **Melting Pot of Food and Identity**

The diverse communities of Singapore played a major role in shaping the city’s hawker culture. Each group brought its own unique flavours, trades, and traditions to the streets, creating a vibrant tapestry of hawkers that catered to all.
