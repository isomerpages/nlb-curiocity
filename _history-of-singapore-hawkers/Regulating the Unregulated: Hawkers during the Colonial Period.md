During Singapore's colonial period and the early years of independence, the idea of enjoying a meal in clean hawker centres was unheard of. People usually ate by the roadside, often using dirty utensils in unhygienic conditions. The transformation into today’s hawker culture – where meals are enjoyed in centralised, clean, and organised spaces – came about through decades of effort and collaboration between the government and hawkers. This section explores this symbiotic relationship, highlighting the regulations, measures, and compromises made by both sides.
