### **Licensing Hawkers**

Following independence, the government tackled the hawker issue through measures like the 1966 Hawkers' Code, which introduced licensing regulations and restricted hawking in congested areas. Licensed hawkers were relocated to less busy sites, while a special squad conducted raids to remove illegal vendors, encouraging able-bodied individuals to seek alternative employment.

| In the years following independence, the government’s efforts to tackle the hawker issue were spearheaded by Minister for Health Yong Nyuk Lin. Recognising that there was an urgent need to resolve the issue, Yong announced in December 1965 that the first step was to start licensing all hawkers and implement a Hawkers’ Code by early 1966. Under the code, only Singaporeans could obtain a hawker licence, and hawkers were prohibited from operating on busy streets, in daytime car parks, near bus stops, schools, or other public buildings. These measures allowed the government to ascertain that the number of street hawkers at the time stood at around 24,000, much lower than the initial estimation of close to 50,000 hawkers.
