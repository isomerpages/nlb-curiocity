### **Licensing Hawkers**

Following independence, the government tackled the hawker issue through measures like the 1966 Hawkers' Code, which introduced licensing regulations and restricted hawking in congested areas. Licensed hawkers were relocated to less busy sites, while a special squad conducted raids to remove illegal vendors, encouraging able-bodied individuals to seek alternative employment.

| In the years following independence, the government’s efforts to tackle the hawker issue were spearheaded by Minister for Health Yong Nyuk Lin. Recognising that there was an urgent need to resolve the issue, Yong announced in December 1965 that the first step was to start licensing all hawkers and implement a Hawkers’ Code by early 1966. Under the code, only Singaporeans could obtain a hawker licence, and hawkers were prohibited from operating on busy streets, in daytime car parks, near bus stops, schools, or other public buildings. These measures allowed the government to ascertain that the number of street hawkers at the time stood at around 24,000, much lower than the initial estimation of close to 50,000 hawkers.

| After registering the street hawkers, the next step was to move them to permanent premises or hawker centres. As it would take time to build these premises, the government started by relocating street hawkers from main roads to less congested such as back lanes, side streets, vacant lots, or car parks. One of the most notable car parks used as a hawker site was the Orchard Road car park, later known as Glutton’s Square. The relocation process needed to be handled with care, and Members of Parliament, along with grassroots leaders, were involved in addressing the concerns and grievances of the displaced hawkers.

| A special squad was established to handle illegal hawkers, conducting street raids alongside auxiliary police officers to remove unlicensed vendors. Offenders were fined and then referred to the Ministry of Labour for job placement. With growing confidence from economic progress and job creation, the Hawkers Department stopped issuing new hawker licenses to able-bodied individuals, especially those under 40, to encourage them to pursue alternative employment opportunities.
