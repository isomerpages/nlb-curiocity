### **Government Hill**

The transformation of Bukit Larangan to Fort Canning Hill took place during the colonial period. Prior to then, however, the British had "claimed" the hill when they hoisted the Union Jack on its top shortly after they arrived in 1819. They then renamed it "Government Hill" after setting up the Governor's House there.
