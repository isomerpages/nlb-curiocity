### **Government Hill**

After the British arrived in 1819, they quickly set their claims on Bukit Larangan when Major-General and first British Resident and Commandant of Singapore William Farquhar climbed up the hill and hoisted the Union Jack. Thereafter, Sir Stamford Raffles built his residence there in 1822 which later became the official residence of Singapore's colonial governors known as Government House in 1823. By then, the hill had been renamed Government Hill although people also referred to it as Singapore Hill, Bukit Tuan Bonham or Sir Bonham's Hill after Governor Sir Samuel George Bonham, and Bukit Bendera, which means Flag Hill.

**The Bute Map**

Fort Canning Hill is captured in many early maps of Singapore including this. Known as "The Brute Map", this 1820 map, which is attributed to Lieutenant Henry Ralfe of the Bengal Artillery who was then the Assistant Engineer of Singapore, is the earliest known landward map of the island. It labeled Fort Canning Hill as "Singapore Hill" and marked out an embankment stretching from the north side of the hill to the mouth of the "Water Place" (Stamford Canal) as "the ancient lines of Singapore". The map also identified other places including the palace of Sultan Husain in Kampong Glam, as well as infrastructure works that were in planning such as a proposed bridge across the river, located between present-day Coleman Bridge and Elgin Bridge.

1836 Coleman Map also marks out Fort Canning Hill (appeared most prominently in this map as Government Hill) (https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/f98c5272-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad)
