### **Government Hill**

After the British arrived in 1819, they quickly set their claims on Bukit Larangan. Besides raising the Union Jack on its summit, a bungalow, which initially served as the residence of Sir Stamford Raffles before becoming the official residence of colonial governors, was built as well. The hill was also renamed "Government Hill" although people sometimes referred to it as "Singapore Hill", "Bukit Bendera" which means "Flag Hill", or simply "The Hill".

It was later used, among other things, to inform the settlement on the arrival of ships in the harbour. The hoisting was recounted by Munshi Abdullah in his autobiography, <span style="font-style: italic;">Hikayat Abdullah</span> (1849) (<a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=13606908" target="_blank">Call no.: RSING 959.5 ABD</a>).

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">"One day Colonel Farquhar wanted to ascend the Forbidden Hill...The Temenggong's men said, 'None of us have the courage to go up the hill because there are many ghosts on it. Every day one can hear on it sounds as of hundreds of men. Sometimes one hears the sound of heavy drums and of people shouting.' Colonel Farquhar laughed and said, 'I should like to see your ghosts' and turning to his Malacca men 'Draw this gun to the top of the hill.' Among them there were several who were frightened, but having no option they pulled the gun up. All who went up were Malacca men, none of the Singapore men daring to approach the hill. On the hill there was not much forest and not many large trees, only a few shrubs here and there. Although the men were frightened, they were ashamed by the presence of Colonel Farquhar and went up whether they wanted or not. When they reached the top Colonel Farquhar ordered the gun to be loaded and then he himself fired twelve rounds in succession over the top of the hill in front of them. Then he ordered a pole to be erected on which he hoisted the English flag. He said, 'Cut down all these bushes.' He also ordered them to make a path for people to go up and down the hill. Everyday there was this work being done, the undergrowth being slashed down and a pathway cleared."</span>

| Fort Canning Hill is captured in many early maps of Singapore including this survey map by Captain Daniel Ross. Titled "Plan of the Singapore Harbour", it was commissioned by Raffles days after his first arrival at Singapore before being published in the *The Calcutta Journal* in May 1819. In the map, Fort Canning Hill is shown situated at the north bank of a river inlet (Singapore River) near its mouth. The hill, which is unnamed in the map, overlooks a cluster of villages. Its walls are also being marked out with the description, "Old Walls of the City". Captain Ross's map is the earliest known survey of Singapore Harbour that marked the first appearance of the name "Singapore" rather than "Singapoora" or "Sincapore" on a map or chart.

| Known as "The Brute Map", this late 1819 map is the earliest known landward map of Singapore. Attributed to Lieutenant Henry Ralfe and named after the Bute Archive in Scotland where it now resides, the map labelled Fort Canning Hill as "Singapore Hill". It also marked out an embankment stretching from the north side of the hill to the mouth of "Water Place" (Stamford Canal) as "the ancient lines of Singapore".

| In this 1846 edition of  the"Plan of Singapore Town and Adjoining Districts" by then Government Surveyor John Turnbull Thomson, Fort Canning Hill has been renamed "Government Hill". Furthermore, two of the hill's most prominent structures at the time - the Government House and the flagstaff - are also been marked out and labelled. Although these two structures and the renamed hill were captured in earlier survey maps including G.D. Coleman's "[Map of the Town and Environs of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/fb0ace86-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad)" (1839), they were not as clearly named as in Thomson's map which is widely seen as the most detailed map of Singapore’s town at the time.

### **Government House**

In November 1822, a residence was built for Raffles and his sister’s family on the hill. It was a wooden bungalow 100 ft long and 50 ft wide, with venetians and an attap roof. The bungalow also had two parallel halls with verandas at both the front and back, and two square wings that served as sleeping quarters. After Raffles left Singapore for the final time in June 1823, the bungalow became the residence of subsequent colonial governors until Fort Canning was built on it in the 1850s.

I am happy to say the change has had a very beneficial effect on my health, which has been better during the last fortnight than I have known it for two years before. The tombs of the Malay Kings are however, close at hand; and I have settled that if it is my fate to die here, I shall take my place amongst them: this will, at any rate, be better than leaving one's bones at Bencoolen..."</span>

| Sketched by Lt. Phillip Jackson on 5 June 1823, this is the earliest known drawing of a view of Singapore from the sea. The drawing provides a rare glimpse of how Singapore looked like at the time. Other than having a row of buildings with attap roof along the seafront, Raffles' bungalow on Fort Canning Hill can also be seen in the background standing near a flag pole. This picture comes from the Drake collection of documents and personal effects belonging to Stamford Raffles, and was published in the July 1953 issue of the Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.

| Raffles' bungalow, which later became the Government House, was also captured in many early paintings at the time including this 1837 litograph. Painted and engraved by Barthelemy Lauvergne and Louis Bichebois respectively, it looks across an open space (today's Padang) towards a somewhat distorted perspective of Fort Canning Hill where Government House and the flagstaff can both be seen. Other 19th century paintings that provide a view of Fort Canning Hill with these structures include John Turnbull Thomson's <a href="https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1052004" target="_blank">"The Esplanade from Scandal Point"</a> (1851) and Percy Carpenter's <a href="https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1054842" target="_blank">"View of Singapore from Mount Wallich"</a> (1856).

| In 1828, Marianne Jane James, wife of the third Bishop of Calcutta Thomas James, painted this piece that not only provides a view of Singapore harbour, but also a close-up of Government House (right) and the flagstaff (centre-right). At the time, the Government House had been made the official residence of the Governor following Raffles' final departure from Singapore in June 1823. It had also been redesigned in the neoclassical style by G. D. Coleman with two new wings being added. In its augmented form, the building served the Governors until Fort Canning Hill was taken over by the military. Thereafter, the Governors began a sojourn of eleven years without an official residence, until the the new Government House (today's Istana) was completed in 1869.

### **Fort Canning Cemetery**

Fort Canning Cemetery was one of the first burial grounds for Christians in Singapore. Located on Fort Canning Hill, the grounds encompassed two burial sites. The first was used from 1819 to 1822, and the second from 1822 to 1865. Fort Canning Cemetery was closed to further burials in 1865, and eventually converted into a park.

Coleman map even the earliest map only shows the second cemetery

The first burial site of Fort Canning Cemetery was located near the hilltop, close to the bungalow that Raffles built. At least three burials were made here. The first was that of John Casamajor, a Commercial Resident of the British East India Company and judge who was visiting from India. He died in Singapore on 1 February 1821. The other two burials were those of John Carnegy, a ship captain who died on 12 February 1821, and John Collingwood, a ship commander who died on 21 November 1821. The cemetery was discontinued at the end of 1822 after it was found to be too close to Raffles’s residence. There are no visible traces of this cemetery.

As the cemetery’s burial register had been lost, the government hired H. A. Stallwood, a clerk, to recompile the burial register by copying details from gravestones. Although his task was complicated by the poor condition of some of the tombstones as well as the haphazard and crowded layout of the cemetery, he was able to complete it. His findings, which came with the above plan showing the locations of all the tombs and monuments there, were later published in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1912.
