### **Government Hill**

After the British arrived in 1819, they quickly set their claims on Bukit Larangan. Besides hoisting the Union Jack on its summit, a bungalow was also built there which initially served as the residence of Sir Stamford Raffles before becoming the official residence of colonial governors. The hill was also renamed "Government Hill" although people sometimes referred to it as "Singapore Hill", "Bukit Bendera" which means "Flag Hill", or simply "The Hill".

| Fort Canning Hill is captured in many early maps of Singapore including this survey map by Captain Daniel Ross. Titled "Plan of the Singapore Harbour", it was commissioned by Raffles days after his first arrival at Singapore before being published in the *The Calcutta Journal* in May 1819. In the map, Fort Canning Hill is shown situated at the north bank of a river inlet (Singapore River) near its mouth. The hill, which is unnamed, overlooks a cluster of villages. Its ancient walls are also being marked out with the description, "Old Walls of the City". Captain Ross's map is the earliest known survey of Singapore Harbour. It also marked the first appearance of the name "Singapore" rather than "Singapoora" or "Sincapore" on a map or chart.

**The Bute Map**

Fort Canning Hill is captured in many early maps of Singapore including this. Known as "The Brute Map", this 1820 map is the earliest known landward map of the island. The map, which was attributed to Lieutenant Henry Ralfe, labeled Fort Canning Hill as "Singapore Hill" and marked out an embankment stretching from the north side of the hill to the mouth of the "Water Place" (Stamford Canal) as "the ancient lines of Singapore". The map also identified other places including the palace of Sultan Husain in Kampong Glam, as well as infrastructure works that were in planning such as a proposed bridge across the river, located between present-day Coleman Bridge and Elgin Bridge.

**Coleman Map**

1836 Coleman Map also marks out Fort Canning Hill (appeared most prominently in this map as Government Hill) (https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/f98c5272-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad)

This 1839 map was one of the earliest survey maps of Singapore. Prepared by George Coleman, Fort Canning Hill is . Also visible are the former grounds

### **Becoming Fort Canning**

### **The Malayan Command**

The Union Jack on Fort Canning Hill was hoisted by the first British Resident and Commandant of Singapore (1819 to 1823) William Farquhar. It was used, among other purposes, to inform the settlement of the approach of European- rigged vessels. The hoisting was recounted by the “father of modern Malay literature” Munshi Abdullah in his autobiography, *Hikayat Abdullah* (or *The Story of Abdullah*) (1849). Click here to read the extract.

"One day Colonel Farquhar wanted to ascend the Forbidden Hill...The Temenggong's men said, 'None of us have the courage to go up the hill because there are many ghosts on it. Every day one can hear on it sounds as of hundreds of men. Sometimes one hears the sound of heavy drums and of people shouting.' Colonel Farquhar laughed and said, 'I should like to see your ghosts' and turning to his Malacca men 'Draw this gun to the top of the hill.' Among them there were several who were frightened, but having no option they pulled the gun up. All who went up were Malacca men, none of the Singapore men daring to approach the hill. On the hill there was not much forest and not many large trees, only a few shrubs here and there. Although the men were frightened, they were ashamed by the presence of Colonel Farquhar and went up whether they wanted or not. When they reached the top Colonel Farquhar ordered the gun to be loaded and then he himself fired twelve rounds in succession over the top of the hill in front of them. Then he ordered a pole to be erected on which he hoisted the English flag. He said, 'Cut down all these bushes.' He also ordered them to make a path for people to go up and down the hill.
