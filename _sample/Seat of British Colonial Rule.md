### **Government Hill**

After the British arrived in 1819, they quickly set their claims on Bukit Larangan. Besides hoisting the Union Jack on its summit, a bungalow, which initially served as the residence of Sir Stamford Raffles before becoming the official residence of colonial governors, was built as well. The hill was also renamed "Government Hill" although people sometimes referred to it as "Singapore Hill", "Bukit Bendera" which means "Flag Hill", or simply "The Hill".

| Fort Canning Hill is captured in many early maps of Singapore including this survey map by Captain Daniel Ross. Titled "Plan of the Singapore Harbour", it was commissioned by Raffles days after his first arrival at Singapore before being published in the *The Calcutta Journal* in May 1819. In the map, Fort Canning Hill is shown situated at the north bank of a river inlet (Singapore River) near its mouth. The hill, which is unnamed in the map, overlooks a cluster of villages. Its walls are also being marked out with the description, "Old Walls of the City". Captain Ross's map is the earliest known survey of Singapore Harbour that marked the first appearance of the name "Singapore" rather than "Singapoora" or "Sincapore" on a map or chart.

| Known as "The Brute Map", this late 1819 map is the earliest known landward map of Singapore. Attributed to Lieutenant Henry Ralfe and named after the Bute Archive in Scotland where it now resides, the map labelled Fort Canning Hill as "Singapore Hill". It also marked out an embankment stretching from the north side of the hill to the mouth of "Water Place" (Stamford Canal) as "the ancient lines of Singapore".

| In this 1846 edition of  the"Plan of Singapore Town and Adjoining Districts" by then Government Surveyor John Turnbull Thomson, Fort Canning Hill has been renamed "Government Hill". Furthermore, two of the hill's most prominent structures at the time - the Government House and the flagstaff - are also been marked out and labelled. Although these two structures and the renamed hill were captured in earlier survey maps including G.D. Coleman's "[Map of the Town and Environs of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/fb0ace86-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad)" (1839), they were as clearly named as in Thomson's map which is widely seen as the most detailed map of Singapore’s town at the time.

### **Government House**

In November 1822, a residence was built for Raffles and his sister’s family on the hill. It was a wooden bungalow 100 ft long and 50 ft wide, with venetians and an attap roof. It had two parallel halls with verandas at both the front and back, and two square wings that served as sleeping quarters. Raffles enjoyed the location so much that he suggested to be buried there.

The earliest known drawing of a view of Singapore, sketched by Lt. Phillip Jackson on 5 June 1823. The drawing shows buildings of Singapore near the seafront and on High Street as viewed from the sea, with the Raffles' residence on Fort Canning Hill near a flag pole in the background. On the left is the inlet of Singapore River. This picture comes from the Drake collection of documents and personal effects belonging to Stamford Raffles.

hill in turn was renamed Government Hill although people also referred to it as Singapore Hill, Bukit Tuan Bonham or Sir Bonham's Hill after governor Sir Samuel George Bonham, and Bukit Bendera, which means Flag Hill.

A one-storey wood and atap structure, it was later occupied by the Second British Resident of Singapore John Crawfurd.

### **Becoming Fort Canning**

### **The Malayan Command**

The Union Jack on Fort Canning Hill was hoisted by the first British Resident and Commandant of Singapore (1819 to 1823) William Farquhar. It was used, among other purposes, to inform the settlement of the approach of European- rigged vessels. The hoisting was recounted by the “father of modern Malay literature” Munshi Abdullah in his autobiography, *Hikayat Abdullah* (or *The Story of Abdullah*) (1849). Click here to read the extract.

"One day Colonel Farquhar wanted to ascend the Forbidden Hill...The Temenggong's men said, 'None of us have the courage to go up the hill because there are many ghosts on it. Every day one can hear on it sounds as of hundreds of men. Sometimes one hears the sound of heavy drums and of people shouting.' Colonel Farquhar laughed and said, 'I should like to see your ghosts' and turning to his Malacca men 'Draw this gun to the top of the hill.' Among them there were several who were frightened, but having no option they pulled the gun up. All who went up were Malacca men, none of the Singapore men daring to approach the hill. On the hill there was not much forest and not many large trees, only a few shrubs here and there. Although the men were frightened, they were ashamed by the presence of Colonel Farquhar and went up whether they wanted or not. When they reached the top Colonel Farquhar ordered the gun to be loaded and then he himself fired twelve rounds in succession over the top of the hill in front of them. Then he ordered a pole to be erected on which he hoisted the English flag. He said, 'Cut down all these bushes.' He also ordered them to make a path for people to go up and down the hill. Everyday there was this work being done, the undergrowth being slashed down and a pathway cleared."
