### **Government Hill**

After the British arrived in 1819, they quickly set their claims on Bukit Larangan. Besides hoisting the Union Jack on it, a bungalow was also built there which intially was the residence of Sir Stamford Raffles before becoming the official residence of colonial governors. The hill was also renamed Government Hill although people also referred to it as Singapore Hill, Bukit Tuan Bonham or Sir Bonham's Hill after Governor Sir Samuel George Bonham, Bukit Bendera which means Flag Hill, or simply the Hill.

The Union Jack on Fort Canning Hill was hoisted by William Farquhar was recounted by...who described the locals' reaction after learning Farquhar's decision, what Farquahr saw on the hill, and...Click here to read an extract from his book.

"One day Colonel Farquhar wanted to ascend the Forbidden Hill...The Temenggong's men said, 'None of us have the courage to go up the hill because there are many ghosts on it. Every day one can hear on it sounds as of hundreds of men. Sometimes one hears the sound of heavy drums and of people shouting.' Colonel Farquhar laughed and said, 'I should like to see your ghosts' and turning to his Malacca men 'Draw this gun to the top of the hill.' Among them there were several who were frightened, but having no option they pulled the gun up. All who went up were Malacca men, none of the Singapore men daring to approach the hill. On the hill there was not much forest and not many large trees, only a few shrubs here and there. Although the men were frightened, they were ashamed by the presence of Colonel Farquhar and went up whether they wanted or not. When they reached the top Colonel Farquhar ordered the gun to be loaded and then he himself fired twelve rounds in succession over the top of the hill in front of them. Then he ordered a pole to be erected on which he hoisted the English flag. He said, 'Cut down all these bushes.' He also ordered them to make a path for people to go up and down the hill. Everyday there was this work being done, the undergrowth being slashed down and a pathway cleared."

**The Bute Map**

Fort Canning Hill is captured in many early maps of Singapore including this. Known as "The Brute Map", this 1820 map, which is attributed to Lieutenant Henry Ralfe of the Bengal Artillery who was then the Assistant Engineer of Singapore, is the earliest known landward map of the island. It labeled Fort Canning Hill as "Singapore Hill" and marked out an embankment stretching from the north side of the hill to the mouth of the "Water Place" (Stamford Canal) as "the ancient lines of Singapore". The map also identified other places including the palace of Sultan Husain in Kampong Glam, as well as infrastructure works that were in planning such as a proposed bridge across the river, located between present-day Coleman Bridge and Elgin Bridge.
