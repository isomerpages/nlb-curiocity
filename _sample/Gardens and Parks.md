Besides being a site for the British to project its power, Fort Canning Hill was also used for recreational activities. In fact, for the past two centuries, the hill was home to not only parks and gardens, but also an aquarium, a swimming pool and even a theatre.

### **The First Botanic Garden**

The Singapore Botanic Gardens today is not the first botanic garden of Singapore. Prior to its establishment in 1859, the British had already explored this idea when they set up a "Botanical and Experimental Garden" on the slopes of Fort Canning Hill.

The prince immediately proposed to visit them…But as they were passing over, they were caught in a severe storm, and the vessels began to leak, and the crews were unable, after repeated exertions, to throw out the water. They were accordingly compelled to throw overboard the greater part of the baggage in the vessel…The water nevertheless continued to gain ground, and every thing was thrown overboard till nothing now remained except the diadem…The prince ordered the diadem to be thrown overboard, the storm ceased and the vessel rose in the water, and the rowers pulled her ashore, and Sang Nila Utama with his attendants, immediately landed on the sands, and went to amuse themselves on the plain near the mouth of the river of Tamasek. There they saw an animal extremely swift and beautiful, its body of a red colour, it head black and its breast white, extremely agile, and of great strength, and its size a little larger than a he-goat. When it saw a great many people, it went towards the island and disappeared. Sang Nila Utiama enquired what animal was this, but none could them, till he enquired Damang Lebar Dawn, who informed him that the histories of ancient time, the sangha or lion was described in the same manner as this animal appeared. This is a fine place which contains so fierce and powerful an animal. Then Sang Nila Utama directed Indra B’hupala to go and inform his mother-in-law, that he should not return…and thus Sang Nila Utama settled the country of Tamasak, named it Singhapura, and reigned over it, and was panegyrized by Bat’h, who gave him the name of Sri Tri-buana."</span>

Table: Raffles's spice gardens

When Wallich proposed the idea, Raffles had set up 

Apart from being a keen naturalist, Raffles’s motivation to set up a botanical garden in Singapore was linked to the colonial tradition of developing such gardens in the tropics for the experimental cultivation of cash crops as well as for the research and preservation of native plants.7  
  
In fact, shortly after Raffles arrived in Singapore in 1819, he had a garden set up beside his home on Government Hill, where spices and trees that he had brought with him were planted.
