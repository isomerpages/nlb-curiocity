Besides being a site for the British to project its power, Fort Canning Hill was also used for recreational activities. In fact, for the past two centuries, the hill was home to not only parks and gardens, but also an aquarium, a swimming pool and even a theatre.

### **The First Botanic Garden**

The Singapore Botanic Gardens today is not the first botanic garden of Singapore. Prior to its establishment in 1859, the British had already explored this idea when they set up a "Botanical and Experimental Garden" on the slopes of Fort Canning Hill.

Danish surgeon and naturalist Nathaniel Wallich and Sir Stamford Raffles were the figures behind the first botanic garden. The duo started to work together on the concept after the former proposed it in his letter to the latter on 2 November 1822.

Apart from being a keen naturalist, Rafflesâ€™s motivation to set up a botanical garden in Singapore was linked to the colonial tradition of developing such spaces in the tropics for the experimental cultivation of cash crops as well as for the research and preservation of native plants...this letter is now part of the collection but has been reproduced in 1913 JMBRAS
