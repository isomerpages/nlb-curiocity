Besides being a site for the British to project its power, Fort Canning Hill was also used for recreational activities. In fact, for the past two centuries, the hill was home to not only parks and gardens, but also an aquarium, a swimming pool and even a theatre.

### **The First Botanic Garden**

The [Singapore Botanic Gardens](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_545_2005-01-24.html) today is not the first botanic garden of Singapore. Prior to its establishment in 1859, the British had already explored this idea when they set up a "Botanical and Experimental Garden" on the slopes of Fort Canning Hill.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">"I request your indulgent attention while I take the liberty of submitting for your consideration some ideas, which have occurred to me relative to the expediency of establishing a Botanic and Experimental Garden on this Island. It would perhaps be impossible to picture to the mind a situation better calculated in every respect to accomplish the ends of such an institution than that, which Singapore represents in reality, placed under circumstances the most favourable for indigenous as well as foreign vegetation and forming part of the richest archipelago in the world - its soil yielding none in fertility, its climate not exceeded by any in uniformity, mildness and salubrity…I beg leave to recommend that a suitable piece of ground may be appropriated in the neighbourhood of the European town for the purposes of a botanic garden and for the experimental cultivation of the indigenous plants of Singapore and the adjacent Islands, as well as of such others of foreign growth, as it might be desirable to submit to a skillful trial, previous to encouraging their general introduction. The expenses of such a garden would, I imagine, be moderate; that they would in the event be infinitely compensated by the beneficial results, which the public at large would derive from its influence."</span>

| The motivation behind the establishment of the first botanic garden in Singapore was linked to the colonial tradition of having such gardens within the Empire for the experimental cultivation of cash crops as well as the research of native plants. In fact, when Wallich brought the idea up to Raffles, he was serving as the superintendent of the Calcutta Botanic Garden (shown above) which has been around since 1787.

In his reply to Wallich, Raffles agreed

Apart from being a keen naturalist, Raffles’s motivation to set up a botanical garden in Singapore was linked to the colonial tradition of developing such gardens in the tropics for the experimental cultivation of cash crops as well as for the research and preservation of native plants...In fact, shortly after Raffles arrived in Singapore in 1819, he had a garden set up beside his home on Government Hill, where spices and trees that he had brought with him were planted.
