Besides being a site for the British to project its power, Fort Canning Hill was also used for recreational activities. In fact, for the past two centuries, the hill was home to not only parks and gardens, but also an aquarium, a swimming pool and even a theatre.

### **The First Botanic Garden**

The [Singapore Botanic Gardens](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_545_2005-01-24.html) today is not the first botanic garden of Singapore. Prior to its establishment in 1859, the British had already explored this idea when they set up a "Botanical and Experimental Garden" on the slopes of Fort Canning Hill.

It would perhaps be impossible to picture to the mind a situation better calculated in every respect to accomplish the ends of such an institution than that, which Singapore represents in reality, placed under circumstances the most favourable for indigenous as well as foreign vegetation and forming part of the richest archipelago in the world - its soil yielding none in fertility, its climate not exceeded by any in uniformity, mildness and salubrity. It abounds in an endless variety of plants equally interesting to the botanist, the agriculturist and the gardener, with unrivalled facilities and opportunities of disseminating these treasures and exchanging them for others...I beg leave to recommend that a suitable piece of ground may be appropriated in the neighbourhood of the European town for the purposes of a botanic garden and for the experimental cultivation of the indigenous plants of Singapore and the adjacent Islands, as well as of such others of foreign growth, as it might be desirable to submit to a skillful trial, previous to encouraging their general introduction. The expenses of such a garden would, I imagine, be moderate; that they would in the event be infinitely compensated by the beneficial results, which the public at large would derive from its influence."</span>

| The motivation behind the establishment of the first botanic garden in Singapore was linked to the colonial tradition of having such gardens within the Empire for the experimental cultivation of cash crops as well as the research of native plants. In fact, when Wallich brought the idea up to Raffles, he was serving as the superintendent of the Calcutta Botanic Garden (shown above) which has been around since 1787.

| Raffles had been toying with the idea of establishing a botanic garden in Singapore since his arrival in 1819. In fact, by the time Wallich submitted his proposal in 1822, there was already an experimental "spice garden" on Fort Canning Hill. Referred to as "Government Garden" by Raffles, it was set up by Singapore's First Resident and Commandant Major-General William Farquhar. The garden had at least some 125 nutmeg trees (shown above) and other crops including clove trees. (Image Credit: [Courtesy of the British Library](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nutmeg_Tree_-_40_drawings_of_plants_at_Bencoolen,_Sumatra_(c.1824)_-_BL_NHD_48-23.jpg){:target="_blank"}) |
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-gardens-botanic-3.jpg)|
| To enable the establishment of the botanic garden that Wallich proposed, Raffles made a personal donation of 1,000 dollars and allocated a 19-hectare site on Fort Canning Hill as shown in this 1828 "Plan of the Town of Singapore". Encompassing the "Government Garden" that Farquhar had established earlier, the grounds of the proposed botanic garden was bounded by Selegie Road to the east, Hill Street to the south and "any extent of ground required" to the north. (Image Credit: [Courtesy of the National Library Board](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nutmeg_Tree_-_40_drawings_of_plants_at_Bencoolen,_Sumatra_(c.1824)_-_BL_NHD_48-23.jpg)|
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-gardens-botanic-4.jpg)|
| Surgeon William Montgomerie was appointed as the supervisor of the botanic garden. Despite being given a budget of only 60 Spanish dollar and manpower of 14 labourers including 3 convicts, he was able to build up the garden quite impressively. By 1827, it had some 900 plants, mostly nutmeg and clove trees and seedlings. Furthermore, at the front of the garden, there was "a brick wall with pillars, and intervals of wood work", while its hill-facing side was bordered up with bamboo fence. In addition, the lower grounds of the gardens were also drained to make way for roads. Montgomerie's work is captured in his 8 February 1827 report to the Resident Councillor of Singapore shown above. (Source: [Montgomerie, William. (1827, February 8). Report upon the present State of the Honorable Company’s Botanical and Experimental Garden at Singapore.](https://www.nas.gov.sg/citizenarchivist/Documents/Transcribe?itemId=6065&collectionId=43){:target="_blank"})|
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/bb-map-2.jpg)|
| However, due to high upkeep, coupled with a lack of funding and government support, the garden was eventually closed in June 1829. Its land was then parcelled out for various public projects including the [Armenian Apostolic Church of St. Gregory the Illuminator](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_809_2004-12-23.html) as shown in 1839 survey map of Singapore town prepared by George D. Coleman.(Image Credit: [Courtesy of National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/fb0ace86-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"})|

### **Christian Cemetery**

Besides the "Botanical and Experimental Garden", Fort Canning Hill was also the site of one of Singapore's earliest Christian burial grounds. Encompassing two burial sites, with the first being used from 1819 to 1822 and the second from 1822 to 1865, the cemetery was closed to further burials after the completion of Bukit Timah Christian Cemetery. Today, the former Fort Canning Cemetery has been converted into a park.

| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-cemetery-1.jpg)|
| The first burial site of Fort Canning Cemetery was located near the hilltop, close to the bungalow that Raffles built. At least three burials were made here. The first was that of John Casamajor, a Commercial Resident of the British East India Company and judge who was visiting from India. He died in Singapore on 1 February 1821. The other two burials were those of John Carnegy, a ship captain who died on 12 February 1821, and John Collingwood, a ship commander who died on 21 November 1821. The cemetery was discontinued at the end of 1822 after it was found to be too close to Raffles’s residence. There are no visible traces of this cemetery unlike the second site which is shown here. (Image Credit: [Courtesy of the National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/ae0977b4-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |
| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-cemetery-2.jpg) |
| The second burial site was located on the slopes of Fort Canning Hill. This two-acre parcel soon became full so the then resident chaplain Reverend Robert Burn, the then resident chaplain applied for a new burial site in 1827. This request resulted in the cemetery to be enlarged instead. Due to the restricted size of the cemetery, segregation of Protestant and Catholic burials was not enforced strictly until 1845. In the same year, the cemetery was again extended to include land to the east of the central path, and in 1846, a brick wall and a pair of gates of Gothic design were built to enclose the cemetery. Around the time of the wall’s construction, two arches were built on the south (seaward) and the land-facing sides of the burial ground.

| As the cemetery’s burial register had been lost, the government hired H. A. Stallwood to recompile the burial register by copying details from gravestones. Although his task was complicated by the poor condition of some of the tombstones as well as the haphazard and crowded layout of the cemetery, he was able to complete it. His findings, which came with the above plan showing the locations of all the tombs and monuments there, were later published in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1912.

| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/fc-cemetery-4.jpg) |
| By the end of 1863, the cemetery was full again, and a new site in Bukit Timah was identified as an alternative burial site. Between 1822 and 1865, more than 600 burials took place at the Fort Canning Cemetery. Around one-third of these burials were those of Chinese Christians. Today, visitors can still find the traces of the old Christian cemetery on Fort Canning Hill. These include the cemetery’s two Gothic gates, the James Brooke Napier Memorial that was built in memory of the infant son of William and Maria Frances Napier, as well as two dome-shaped cupolas.

The latest discovered is dated 1868, erected to the memory of Marie Dominica Scott, a child of only two years of age, and the interment presumably took place after the Cemetery was closed in 1865, as the parents were possibly interred here."</span>

### **King George V Park**

King George V Park was completed around 1938. Located southwest of Fort Canning Hill at the junction of River Valley Road and Clemenceau Avenue, it was named this way to to mark the 1935 silver jubilee of King George V and Queen Mary. The park was very popular park during the postwar period. In 1972, it was incorporated into today's Fort Canning Park which is one of the most frequented parks in Singapore.

| The site where King George V Park sat was the railway yard of the former Tank Road Railway Station. Opened in 1906, it served as the terminus for passenger trains in Singapore for the [Singapore Railway Line](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_953_2005-01-25.html) until the completion of the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station in 1932.

Scores of scraggy kids can be seen emerging from their rambling homes a stone's throw away, like rabbits out of their holes, to play on the green grass in the cool of the evening. It is a familiar sight to see a group of five or six boys lolling on the grass in a shady nook or playing a game of imitation Blind Man's Bluff. From 5.30 or 6 p.m. onwards every day, one can see a flow of these children into the park, from babes-in-arms to the age of adolescence. Some are accompanied by their parents. Peals of laughter rise above the din of the busy traffic and the park rings with a hundred gay young voices of children at play. The few swings and chutes that are there to delight the kiddies and young visitors are always occupied. In another corner, some wide-eyed toddler is being fed by Mama. A large number of these children, shut out from all sunlight in their rickety homes across the road, are in need of fresh air and sunshine more than food. Although it doesn't boast of being a second Hype Park, this green enclosure with its many shady trees and flowering shrubs is regarded by many as the Colony's most beautiful public garden."</span>

| Some of the trees in the dense mass of variegated foliage of King George V Park included Flame of the forest, the Yellow flame, the Bungor tree, Jacarandas, Cassias and Tembusu. They were planted when the park was built before the war. As it became a Japanese military area during the Japanese Occupation, these plantings were left undisturbed and thus able to flourish.

| In 1972, King George V Park was incorporated into a larger park. Initially called Central Park before being renamed Fort Canning Park in 1981, this new 100-acre park was dubbed the "biggest ever green lung" in the city area at the time. It included King George V Park and the former grounds of the headquarters of the Malaya Command on Fort Canning Hill which by then had come under the purview of the Singapore Armed Forces. Today, Fort Canning Park continues to be a public park. It is also a venue for celebrations and events, having hosted concerts, theatre productions and festivals.
