Before the British arrival in 1819, Singapore already has a settlement with a history that stretches back to the 14th century. Commonly referred to as Singapura (“Lion City”) or Temasek, this early settlement was also mentioned in historical texts as *Chiamassie* and *Danmaxi* among others.

### **Capturing Early Singapore in Maps**

Ancient maps are a useful way to find out if a particular location such as Temasek was significant in some way. Geographical maps can be a visual representation of [knowledge and power](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-17/issue-4/jan-to-mar-2022/asia-maps-cartography) in the sense that they can map out geographical locations, landmarks, as well as important trade locations. Cosmographical maps on the other hand can represent ideas about [the world](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-11/issue-1/apr-jun-2015/search-sg-old-map) as well as belief systems.

| This “Undecima Asiae Tabula” (1478 CE) map is possibly one of the oldest maps of Singapore. It depicts one of twelve regions of Asia and is based on Claudius Ptolemaeus’ 2nd century work *Hyphegesis Geographike* (“Guide to Geography”). Southeast Asia is depicted as *India Extra Gangem* (Further India). Ptolemaeus’ work gave 16 coordinates for the Aurea *Khersonesos* (Golden Peninsula), a location which scholars such as Wheatley ([1966](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=203057442)) interpret to be the Malay Peninsula. Two were mentioned as *emporio* or places where foreign trade was allowed and taxed; Takola in the north and *Sabana* (possibly Singapore) at the southern end. Wheatley ([1955](https://www.jstor.org/stable/621273)) and Colless ([1969](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20067728)) were the main proponents of this theory while others such as Gerini ([1909](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/detail/7aba5b63-ee38-4765-937c-1ea035bf1ba2.aspx)) and Linehan ([1951](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41503002)) thought *Sabana* might be in Selangor, further north in the Malay Peninsula.

| This *Mao Kun* (茅坤) Map from *Wu Bei Zhi* (武备志) (1628 CE) depicted places in or around the Singapore Straits, such as [*Temasek*](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/d24d6da6-0013-4a12-a6bc-68ad1497148e) (淡马锡), *Long Ya Men* (龍牙門) ([Dragon’s Tooth Strait](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-10/issue-3/oct-dec-2014/dragons-tooth-strait), or [Batu Berlayar](https://www.roots.gov.sg/places/places-landing/Places/historic-sites/batu-berlayar)), and [*Banzu*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41493463) (班卒). A Chinese military treatise compiled by Mao Yuanyi (茅元儀), the *Wu Bei Zhi* is said to have been based on Admiral Zheng He’s (郑和) expeditions of the Indian Ocean (see [Wade 2005](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41493537)). The map is believed to have been made in 1425-1430 and the chart used two navigational techniques: the Chinese 24-point compass and the “star altitude” technique ([Mok 2019](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/detail/594f089e-283a-4386-b865-7c4b9e359ff3.aspx)).

| These map of the Straits of Singapore (1604 CE) are part of a larger work called [*Malaca, L'Inde Orientale et le Cathay ; Malaca, L'Inde Méridionale et le Cathay*](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/detail/b44dd395-4a9a-4394-a9bf-4b7745a8eb74.aspx) by Manuel Godinho de Erédia, a Melaka-born half-Portuguese half-Bugis naval commander. He led a squadron of 70 ships that guarded the southern end of the Straits of Melaka and is known for his blockade of Johor and the destruction of Johor Lama. The map is significant in that it shows place names on Singapore island itself such as Blakang Mati (now Sentosa), Tanjong Rhu, Sungei Bedok, Tanah Merah, Tanjong Rusa, and Selat Tebrau (see Gibson-Hill [1956](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=4077989)). Erédia created the maps sometime around 1564, and ordered that a fort be built in Singapore in 1604, but it is unclear whether one was ever built. J. V. Mills ([1930](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41560454)) has translated the work into English.

### **Early Singapore In Archaeology Digs**

Artifacts on the other hand can provide some physical evidence for whether a site was settled and how long it might have been in use prior to abandonment, and the information can test or complement the known textual evidence. The existing [open air museum of the 1988 Fort Canning excavation site](https://www.roots.gov.sg/places/places-landing/Places/surveyed-sites/Archaeological-Excavation-Site-at-Fort-Canning-Park) (FTC) which is open daily to visitors suggests that Fort Canning Hill area was part of a larger 14th century settlement in Singapore which includes the parts of the Civic District as well as the banks of the Singapore River.

| The [Singapore Stone](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_43_2005-01-26.html) is a sandstone slab inscribed with an ancient script that once stood at the mouth of the Singapore River. An [1825](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/fb6e9ffb-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad) map shows the original location of the Singapore Stone at Rocky Point near the present-day Fullerton Hotel. Originally about 3 meters high and 3 meters wide and said to contain about 50 lines of inscriptions, it was blown up in 1843 under the orders of the settlement engineer Captain Stevenson to provide space for Fort Fullerton and its living quarters. Fragments of the stone were sent to Kolkata in India in 1848 for study, with the remaining fragment remaining in Singapore. Scholars believed that the ancient script was likely to be either in Old Javanese (Kawi) or Sanskrit and might date to the 11th\-14th centuries (see Miksic [1985](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=4080784): 13 and Sinclair [2019](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=204343146): 49-51).

| In 1928, 10 [ancient gold ornaments](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-17/issue-3/oct-dec-2021/ancientgold) said to be related to the Majapahit Empire were accidentally discovered during the construction of the [Fort Canning Reservoir](https://www.roots.gov.sg/places/places-landing/Places/surveyed-sites/Fort-Canning-Service-Reservoir). These items could have been hidden during a Siamese attack at the end of the 14th century. Only four ornaments remained after the [Japanese Occupation](https://learning.nlb.gov.sg/singapore/adults/content-japanese-occupation); the whereabouts of the other six are unknown.

| In 1984 on Fort Canning Hill, Prof. John Miksic led an [archaeological research project](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=4080784) to test whether remains of ancient Singapore could be found. One of the excavation pits located near Keramat [Iskandar Shah](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1540_2009-07-06.html) (KIS) yielded two significant objects made of Chinese porcelain: a compass (shown above) and a porcelain pillow which depicted theatrical images. So far, the porcelain compass is the only one of its kind known to exist. (Image Credit: John N.

| Fort Canning was excavated several times after 1984, usually prior to planned development. This blue glass bead was found at the Fort Canning Spice Gardens excavation during the construction of a wheelchair ramp and is suspected to be from a 14th century yielding layer. At a nearby site located 25 meters to the west, 159 glass beads were found during an archaeological excavation at Fort Canning (FTC) in 1988. Other artifacts, such as irregularly shaped globules (blobs), shards of thin-walled containers, beads, and bangle fragments were also found. Based on the irregular shaped globules, the site was suspected to be a glass workshop. It was thought that the glass was imported.

| This green porcelain bowl is a unique example excavated at the Fort Canning Spice Gardens in 2010 and is likely to be a product of the Guangdong Xicun kiln area. The designs located within the bowl appear to be “variations on the eight treasures.” Many Chinese ceramics dating to the late Song and Yuan dynasties were found in Fort Canning. Some ceramics on the Hill were of a finer quality that lends merit to the idea that the Hill may have been an area for elites in the 14th century, and that Singapore was a trading hub in an ancient maritime trading network; a part of the [Silk Road of the Sea](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=200123868).
