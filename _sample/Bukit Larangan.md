### **Bukit Larangan: Ancient Singapore in Maps, Texts, and Artifacts**

The island of Singapore has had [many names in the past](https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-land-before-1819/the-land-before-1819), including Singapura (“Lion City”) and Temasek. Prior to 1822, [Fort Canning Hill](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_8_2004-12-10.html) was known by locals as Bukit Larangan (meaning “Forbidden Hill”), where ancient kings were believed to be buried. What kind of evidence do we have of ancient Singapore, particularly by way of maps, texts, and artifacts?

### **Ancient Singapore in Maps**

Ancient maps are a useful way to find out if a particular location such as Temasek was significant in some way. Geographical maps can be a visual representation of [knowledge and power](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-17/issue-4/jan-to-mar-2022/asia-maps-cartography) in the sense that they can map out geographical locations, landmarks, as well as important trade locations. Cosmographical maps on the other hand can represent ideas about [the world](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-11/issue-1/apr-jun-2015/search-sg-old-map) as well as belief systems.

| This “Undecima Asiae Tabula” (1478 CE) map is possibly one of the oldest maps of Singapore. It depicts one of twelve regions of Asia and is based on Claudius Ptolemaeus’ 2nd century work _Hyphegesis Geographike_ (“Guide to Geography”). Southeast Asia is depicted as _India Extra Gangem_ (Further India). Ptolemaeus’ work gave 16 coordinates for the _Aurea Khersonesos_ (Golden Peninsula), a location which scholars such as Wheatley ([1966](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=203057442)) interpret to be the Malay Peninsula. Two were mentioned as _emporio_—places where foreign trade was allowed and taxed; Takola in the north and Sabana—possibly Singapore—at the southern end. Wheatley ([1955](https://www.jstor.org/stable/621273)) and Colless ([1969](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20067728)) were the main proponents of this theory while others such as Gerini ([1909](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/detail/7aba5b63-ee38-4765-937c-1ea035bf1ba2.aspx)) and Linehan ([1951](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41503002)) thought Sabana might be in Selangor, further north in the Malay Peninsula.
