Before the British arrival in 1819, Singapore was already a settlement with a history that stretches back to the 14th century. Commonly referred to as Singapura (“Lion City”) or Temasek, this early settlement was also mentioned in historical texts as Chiamassie and Danmaxi among others.

| This “Undecima Asiae Tabula” (1478 CE) map is possibly one of the oldest maps of Singapore. It depicts one of twelve regions of Asia and is based on Claudius Ptolemaeus’ 2nd century work _Hyphegesis Geographike_ (“Guide to Geography”). Southeast Asia is depicted as _India Extra Gangem_ (Further India). Ptolemaeus’ work gave 16 coordinates for the _Aurea Khersonesos_ (Golden Peninsula), a location which scholars such as Wheatley ([1966](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=203057442)) interpret to be the Malay Peninsula. Two were mentioned as _emporio_—places where foreign trade was allowed and taxed; Takola in the north and Sabana—possibly Singapore—at the southern end. Wheatley ([1955](https://www.jstor.org/stable/621273)) and Colless ([1969](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20067728)) were the main proponents of this theory while others such as Gerini ([1909](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/detail/7aba5b63-ee38-4765-937c-1ea035bf1ba2.aspx)) and Linehan ([1951](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41503002)) thought Sabana might be in Selangor, further north in the Malay Peninsula.

| This _Mao Kun_ 茅坤 Map from _Wu Bei Zhi_ 武备志 (1628 CE) depicted places in or around the Singapore Straits, such as [Temasek](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/d24d6da6-0013-4a12-a6bc-68ad1497148e) 淡马锡, Long Ya Men 龍牙門 ([Dragon’s Tooth Strait](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-10/issue-3/oct-dec-2014/dragons-tooth-strait), or [Batu Berlayar](https://www.roots.gov.sg/places/places-landing/Places/historic-sites/batu-berlayar)), and [Banzu](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41493463) 班卒 Pancur. A Chinese military treatise compiled by Mao Yuanyi 茅元儀, the _Wu Bei Zhi_ is said to have been based on Admiral Zheng He’s 郑和 expeditions of the Indian Ocean (see [Wade 2005](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41493537)). The map is believed to have been made in 1425-1430 and the chart used two navigational techniques: the Chinese 24-point compass and the “star altitude” technique ([Mok 2019](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/detail/594f089e-283a-4386-b865-7c4b9e359ff3.aspx)).

| These map of the Straits of Singapore (1604 CE) are part of a larger work called _[Malaca, L'Inde Orientale et le Cathay ; Malaca, L'Inde Méridionale et le Cathay](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/detail/b44dd395-4a9a-4394-a9bf-4b7745a8eb74.aspx)_ by Manuel Godinho de Erédia, a Melaka-born half-Portuguese half-Bugis naval commander. He led a squadron of 70 ships that guarded the southern end of the Straits of Melaka and is known for his blockade of Johor and the destruction of Johor Lama. The map is significant in that it shows place names on Singapore island itself such as Blakang Mati (now Sentosa), Tanjong Rhu, Sungei Bedok, Tanah Merah, Tanjong Rusa, and Selat Tebrau (see Gibson-Hill [1956](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=4077989)). Erédia created the maps sometime around 1564, and ordered that a fort be built in Singapore in 1604, but it is unclear whether one was ever built. J. V. Mills ([1930](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41560454)) has translated the work into English.
