### **Bukit Larangan: Ancient Singapore in Maps, Texts, and Artifacts**

The island of Singapore has had [many names in the past](https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-land-before-1819/the-land-before-1819), including Singapura (“Lion City”) and Temasek. Prior to 1822, [Fort Canning Hill](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_8_2004-12-10.html) was known by locals as Bukit Larangan (meaning “Forbidden Hill”), where ancient kings were believed to be buried. What kind of evidence do we have of ancient Singapore, particularly by way of maps, texts, and artifacts?

### **Ancient Singapore in Maps**

Ancient maps are a useful way to find out if a particular location such as Temasek was significant in some way. Geographical maps can be a visual representation of [knowledge and power](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-17/issue-4/jan-to-mar-2022/asia-maps-cartography) in the sense that they can map out geographical locations, landmarks, as well as important trade locations. Cosmographical maps on the other hand can represent ideas about [the world](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-11/issue-1/apr-jun-2015/search-sg-old-map) as well as belief systems.

| Fort Canning Hill is captured in many early maps of Singapore including this survey map by Captain Daniel Ross. Titled "Plan of the Singapore Harbour", it was commissioned by Raffles days after his first arrival at Singapore before being published in the *The Calcutta Journal* in May 1819. In the map, Fort Canning Hill is shown situated at the north bank of a river inlet (Singapore River) near its mouth. The hill, which is unnamed in the map, overlooks a cluster of villages. Its walls are also being marked out with the description, "Old Walls of the City". Captain Ross's map is the earliest known survey of Singapore Harbour that marked the first appearance of the name "Singapore" rather than "Singapoora" or "Sincapore" on a map or chart.
