### **Bukit Larangan: Ancient Singapore in Maps, Texts, and Artifacts**

The island of Singapore has had [many names in the past](https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-land-before-1819/the-land-before-1819), including Singapura (“Lion City”) and Temasek. Prior to 1822, [Fort Canning Hill](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_8_2004-12-10.html) was known by locals as Bukit Larangan (meaning “Forbidden Hill”), where ancient kings were believed to be buried. What kind of evidence do we have of ancient Singapore, particularly by way of maps, texts, and artifacts?

**Ancient Singapore in Maps**

Ancient maps are a useful way to find out if a particular location such as Temasek was significant in some way. Geographical maps can be a visual representation of [knowledge and power](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-17/issue-4/jan-to-mar-2022/asia-maps-cartography) in the sense that they can map out geographical locations, landmarks, as well as important trade locations. Cosmographical maps on the other hand can represent ideas about [the world](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-11/issue-1/apr-jun-2015/search-sg-old-map) as well as belief systems.
