Riding on the trend, some hawkers from Singapore have ventured abroad to showcase the country's hawker food. For example, this photograph shows a chicken rice stall in Urban Hawker. Located in New York City, Urban Hawker is a 15,000-square-foot food court that recreates the vibrant atmosphere of our hawker centers. Featuring 17 vendors handpicked by Makansutra's KF Seetoh, diners could experience the local flavors of White Restaurant's white bee hoon, the rich aroma of Kopifellas' Nanyang kopi, the savory delights of Ashes Burnnit's halal burgers, and the classic comfort of Hainan Jones' Hainanese chicken rice.
