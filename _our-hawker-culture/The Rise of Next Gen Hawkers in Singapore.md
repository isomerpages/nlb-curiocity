Singapore's hawker culture and heritage is undoubtedly a cornerstone of the nation's identity. Having being enshrined on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list, this beloved tradition, as seen from its journey from street vending to contemporary hawker centres, is not merely a relic of the past but a living, breathing entity that continues to evolve. In the face of changing demographics and shifting culinary trends, a new generation of hawkers is stepping forward, injecting fresh energy and innovation into this cherished heritage.
