Jurong is an area in the southwest of Singapore. Comprising of housing estates such as Jurong West and Jurong East as well as the innovation, business and industrial estates of Jurong Lake District and the Jurong Innovation District among others, it was a very different place before its development in the 1960s. Largely undeveloped, it was an area of littered with villages, swamps, patches of jungles and plantations with numerous river, steams and tributaries.

Another version is that before the area between Bras Basah Road and Stamford was filled in, cargoes of rice were brought by boats into the lagoon and spread to dry on the road. On one occasion, high tides wet the rice."</span>

| The 1828 map of Singapore by Captain James Franklin and Lieutenant Philip Jackson shown above is one of the earliest maps to accurately depict Singapore Island. It provides valuable information about the natural features associated with Jurong, highlighting the Jurong and Pandan rivers and identifies the islands that now collectively form Jurong Island, including Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Seraya, and Pulau Sakra. The map also marks geographical features in the Tuas area, such as Tanjong Rawa (a promontory) and Tanjong Gull (Tanjong Gul). These details offer insights into the historical geography of the Jurong region.

| The natural features of Jurong, including the Jurong and Pandan rivers, were also depicted on the 1855 hydrographic survey of the Straits of Singapore shown above. This survey, conducted by Captain Samuel Congalton and Government Surveyor John Turnbull Thomson, stands as one of the earliest comprehensive hydrographic surveys of the region carried out by a surveyor based locally. It provides a detailed and valuable portrayal of the geographical characteristics of the Jurong area.

| While the early 19th-century maps of Singapore provided detailed information about the natural features of Jurong, maps from the later half of the 19th century and the early 20th century showed a much smaller boundary for Jurong compared to what we know today. For instance, in this 1885 map of the island of Singapore show above, Jurong was defined by the Pandan River to the south, West Bukit Timah to the north, Upper Tanglin to the east, and Peng Kang to the west. This illustrates how the geographical understanding and delineation of Jurong evolved over time.

| In this 1924 map displaying the mukim numbers of various survey districts in Singapore, Jurong is marked with the mukim number "X" or "10." Since the early 1900s, each land parcel in Singapore has been uniquely identified by a lot number, which consists of two parts: the survey district's Mukim (or Town Subdivision) number and the lot number itself. Singapore is administratively divided into 34 Mukims and 30 Town Subdivisions, and this system helps in locating and organizing land parcels within the country.

### **Peng Kang and Jurong**

In the 19th century, much of the forests in and around Jurong were cleared to make way for gambier plantations. The cash crop was so popular that Jurong was sometimes referred to as&nbsp;"Peng Kang", which may be derived from a Malay term for boiling gambier leaves. But in general, Peng Kang is a survey district (or Mukim) that is west of Jurong and it covers the areas we know today as Jurong West and Boon Lay.

The name Peng Keng (together with Jurong) could first be seen in maps dating back to as early as the first half of the 19th century. For example, in this 1844 map of Singapore Island which was surveyed and drawn by Government Surveyor John Turnbull Thomson, the name "Pengkang" is indicated west of Sungei Jurong and adjacent to Jurong, which is spelt "Joorong". This map was produced during Thomson's tenure as Government Surveyor where he conducted a series of important surveys including the allotment and topotraphical survey of the island as well as the marine survey of the Straits of Singapore.

In the 19th century, large tracts of primary forest in Peng Keng as well as in other parts of the island were cleared to make way for plantations. In this 1855 map of the island of Singapore, the plantations in Peng Keng as well as its surronding including Tengah (spelt "Tengeh"), Lim Chu Kang, Jurong and Pandan were predominately gambier and pepper.

The gambier industry waned in the late 1800s, but rubber, a new cash crop, started to grow in prominence. Boosted by global demand for rubber in the early 1900s, rubber plantations replaced gambier estates. Prominent businessmen who owned rubber plantations in Jurong included pioneer entrepreneur Chew Boon Lay. Aside from rubber, Chew was involved in many businesses including barter trading and the Ho Ho Biscuit Factory, which was set up in 1898. Chew died in 1933 and was buried in Bukit Brown Cemetery. Today, Boon Lay Road and Boon Lay Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station were both named after him.

Although Peng Keng had been renamed Jurong West and Boon Lay, traces of it could still be found in the forms of Peng Keng Avenue and the upcoming Peng Keng Hill MRT station along the Jurong Regional Line. Despite the changes, Peng Keng's survey district number, Mukim XX, which was assigned in the early 1900s is still in used today as part of the Singapore Land Authority's....

### **Communities of Early Jurong**

The clearing of the forests and swamps in Jurong and its surroundings such as Peng Keng brought new settlers to the area. These settlers, predominately Chinese, eventually settled in villages, joining the local Malay and Orang Laut communities who had been living there especially along the coastal area even before the arrival of the British.

The Orang Laut were sea and river-based nomads who had lived in Singapore and the region since at least the 16th century. Some of their tribes or sukus that were recorded by the British after their arrival included Orang Biduanda Kallang, Orang Galang, Orang Gelam, Orang Seletar, Orang Selat and Orang Sembulun. The Orang Sembulun were likely located in Pulau Samulun which is located off the coast of Jurong at the end of Jurong River. Shown above is a print (lithograph) that depicts a canoe with an American flag on its stern drawing near the huts on the Jurong river bank. It was drawn by Peter Bernhard Wilhelm Heine who was on board Commodore Matthew Perry's 1854 expedition to Japan.

Besides the Orang Laut, the local Malays had also been living along the Jurong River and in coastal areas of Jurong. Despite having a culture that was distinct from the Orang Laut, both the Malays and the Orang Laut shared a symbiotic relationship, often  serving as the naval forces of a number of Malay Kingdoms. Apart from that, both communities lived off the land and sea around them by carrying out subsistence fishing, gathering plants and fruits from the forest for medicine and food, and utilised freshwater streams. Shown above is a photograph taken of a fishing village at Jurong River in the 1950s.

The establishment of plantations after the arrival of the British in 1819 brought new settlers to the Jurong area. Mostly from China, they took on the backbreaking task of clearing forests and swamps for the establishment of pepper and gambier plantations before working as labourers in them. These early Chinese settlers were predominately the Ann Kway Hokkiens from Anxi county in Fujian Province, China. They would later be joined by the Teochews hailing from the Jieyang Provnice. The Hokkeins and Teochews would eventually settled in kampongs or villages there. Many of these kampongs were located between the 7th and 18th milestone along Jurong Road which was one of the oldest roads in the western part of Singapore. The majority of the Teochews lived at the 18th milestones near the coast working as fishermen. Like the Hokkiens, they also worked as plantation and fruit farm workers. Shown above is a photograph of Hong Kah Village taken in 19XX. Established in the early 1800s, it was once located at the 12th milestone of Jurong Road. Its name comes from the Hokkien and Teochew term for "bestowing a religion", which was also the colloquial name for Chinese Christians at the time.

In the early 20th century, numerous factors including the proliferation of rubber plantations, the establishment of British military bases and expansion of the road and transportation network in the rural areas including Jurong saw the growth of existing and new villages. By the end of the 1950s, many of these rural villages were not only equipped with basic facilities and services such as schools, places of worship, markets, provision shops and even clinics. Shown above is the Sin Nan Public School which was established in 1932&nbsp;near Hong Kah Village. Today, the school is located in Jurong West and is known as Xingnan Primary School.
