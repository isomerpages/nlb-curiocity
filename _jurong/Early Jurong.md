Jurong is an area in the southwest of Singapore. Comprising of housing estates such as Jurong West and Jurong East as well as the innovation, business and industrial estates of Jurong Lake District and the Jurong Innovation District among others, it was a very different place before its development in the 1960s. Largely undeveloped, it was an area of swamps, jungles and plantations with numerous river, steams and tributaries.

### **Jurong in Early Maps of Singapore**

, the areas we know today as Jurong West and Boon Lay were once Peng Kang, while Jurong itself was a samller slice of land between Peng Keng and Bukit Timah. be found in early colonial maps of Singapore, often associated that we know today is largely associated  demarcated as a large area today, it was vastly different back then.

Captain James Franklin and Lieutenant Philip Jackson's 1828 map of Singapore (shown above), which is one of the earliest maps that properly captured the outline of Singapore Island, details a number of natural features associated with Jurong including the Jurong and Pandan rivers, as well as the former islands that made up Jurong Island today such as Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Seraya and Pulau Sakra. In the Tuas area, Tanjong (or promontory) Rawa and Tanjong Gull (Tanjong Gul) were also indicated in the map.

These natural features of Jurong including Jurong and Pandan rivers were also indicated in this 1855 hydrographic survey of the Straits of Singapore (shown above). Drawn by Captain Samuel Congalton and Government Surveyor John Turnbull Thomson, this map is one of the first detailed hydrographic surveys of the Straits to be conducted by a locally based surveyor.

While early 19th century maps of Singapore captured the natural features of Jurong , those that were produced in the later half as well as the early 20th century indicated that the boundary of Jurong is only a fraction of the locale we know today. For instance, in this 1885 map of the island of Singapore, Jurong is bounded by Pandan in the south, West Bukit Timah in the north, Upper Tanglin in the east, and Peng Kang in the west.

In this 1924 map of which shows the mukim numbers of different survey districts of Singapore, Jurong's mukim number is indicated as "X" or "10". Since the early 1900s, every land parcel in Singapore is uniquely identified by a lot number. This identifier has two components, namely the survey districts Mukim (or Town Subdivision) number and the lot number. For administrative purposes, Singapore is divided into 34 Mukims and 30 Town Subdivisions.

### **Peng Kang**

In the 19th century, much of the forests in and around Jurong were cleared to make way for gambier plantations. The cash crop was so popular that Jurong was sometimes referred to as "Peng Kang", which may be derived from a Malay term for boiling gambier leaves. But in general, Peng Kang is a survey district (or Mukim) that is west of Jurong and it covers the areas we know today as Jurong West and Boon Lay.

The name Peng Keng (together with Jurong) could first be seen in maps dating back to as early as the first half of the 19th century. For example, in this 1844 map of Singapore Island which was surveyed and drawn by Government Surveyor John Turnbull Thomson, the name "Pengkang" is indicated west of Sungei Jurong and adjacent to Jurong, which is spelt "Joorong". This map was produced during Thomson's tenure as Government Surveyor where he conducted a series of important surveys including the allotment and topotraphical survey of the island as well as the marine survey of the Straits of Singapore.

In the 19th century, large tracts of primary forest in Peng Keng as well as in other parts of the island were cleared to make way for plantations. In this 1855 map of the island of Singapore, the plantations in Peng Keng as well as its surronding including Tengah (spelt "Tengeh"), Lim Chu Kang, Jurong and Pandan were predominately gambier and pepper.

The gambier industry waned in the late 1800s, but rubber, a new cash crop, started to grow in prominence. Boosted by global demand for rubber in the early 1900s, rubber plantations replaced gambier estates. Prominent businessmen who owned rubber plantations in Jurong included pioneer entrepreneur Chew Boon Lay. Aside from rubber, Chew was involved in many businesses including barter trading and the Ho Ho Biscuit Factory, which was set up in 1898. Chew died in 1933 and was buried in Bukit Brown Cemetery. Today, Boon Lay Road and Boon Lay Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station were both named after him.

Although Peng Keng had been renamed Jurong West and Boon Lay, traces of it could still be found in the forms of Peng Keng Avenue and the upcoming Peng Keng Hill MRT station along the Jurong Regional Line. Despite the changes, Peng Keng's survey district number, Mukim XX, which was assigned in the early 1900s is still in used today as part of the Singapore Land Authority's....

### **Communities of Early Jurong**

The clearing of the forests and swamps in Jurong and its surroundings such as Peng Keng brought new settlers to the area. These settlers, predominately Chinese, together with their friends and relatives would then settle in small villages there, joining the local Malay and Orang Laut communities who had been living in their villages along the coastal area even before the arrival of the British.

The Orang Laut were sea and river-based nomads who had lived in Singapore and the region since at least the 16th century. Some of their tribes or sukus that were recorded by the British after their arrival included Orang Biduanda Kallang, Orang Galang, Orang Gelam, Orang Seletar, Orang Selat and Orang Sembulun. The Orang Sembulun were likely located in Pulau Samulun which is located off the coast of Jurong at the end of Jurong River. Shown above is a print (lithograph) that depicts a canoe with an American flag on its stern drawing near the huts on the Jurong river bank. It was drawn by Peter Bernhard Wilhelm Heine who was on board Commodore Matthew Perry's 1854 expedition to Japan.

Besides the Orang Laut, the local Malays had also been living along the Jurong River and in coastal areas of Jurong. Despite having a culture that was distinct from the Orang Laut, both the Malays and the Orang Laut shared a symbiotic relationship, often  serving as the naval forces of a number of Malay Kingdoms. Apart from that, both communities lived off the land and sea around them by carrying out subsistence fishing, gathering plants and fruits from the forest for medicine and food, and utilised freshwater streams. Shown above is a photograph taken of a fishing village at Jurong River in the 1950s.

New Kampongs

The establishment of plantations after the arrival of the British in 1819 brought new settlers to the Jurong area. Mostly from China, they took on the backbreaking task of clearing forests and swamps for the establishment of pepper and gambier plantations before working as labourers in them. These early Chinese settlers were predominately the Ann Kway Hokkiens from Anxi county in Fujian Province, China, and the villages they founded were located along the rivers and the early rural roads at the time such as Jurong Road. The Ann Kway Hokkiens would later be joined by the Teochews hailing from the Jieyang province.

In the early 20th century, numerous factors including the proliferation of rubber plantations, the establishment of British military bases and expansion of the road and transportation network in the rural areas including Jurong saw the growth of existing and new villages in terms of functions and activities. By the end of the 1950s, many of these rural villages were not only equipped with basic facilities and services such as schools, places of worship, markets, provision shops and even clinics, but also engaging in agricultural activities such as growing vegetables and fruits.

started mushrooming along the flanks of newly-constructed roads that radiated from the town such as Jurong Road, and they typically comprised plantations growing pepper and gambier were among the most popular cash crops between the 1830s and 1870s. This phase of development was marked by the continually shifting locations of bangsals which were the areas cleared and cultivated with Gambier and Pepper and included the processing facilities and ‘coolie lines’ (accommodation). Usually located along major rivers including Jurong River, there were numerous bangsals within a Kangkar which was the riverine village headquarters for the Kangchu (head man).
