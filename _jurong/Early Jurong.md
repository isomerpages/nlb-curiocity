Jurong is an area in the southwest of Singapore. Comprising of housing estates such as Jurong West and Jurong East as well as the innovation, business and industrial estates of Jurong Lake District and the Jurong Innovation District among others, it was a very different place before its development in the 1960s. Largely undeveloped, it was an area of littered with villages, swamps, patches of jungles and plantations with numerous river, steams and tributaries.

Another version is that before the area between Bras Basah Road and Stamford was filled in, cargoes of rice were brought by boats into the lagoon and spread to dry on the road. On one occasion, high tides wet the rice."</span>

| The 1828 map of Singapore by Captain James Franklin and Lieutenant Philip Jackson shown above is one of the earliest maps to accurately depict Singapore Island. It provides valuable information about the natural features associated with Jurong, highlighting the Jurong and Pandan rivers and identifies the islands that now collectively form Jurong Island, including Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Seraya, and Pulau Sakra. The map also marks geographical features in the Tuas area, such as Tanjong Rawa (a promontory) and Tanjong Gull (Tanjong Gul). These details offer insights into the historical geography of the Jurong region.

| The natural features of Jurong, including the Jurong and Pandan rivers, were also depicted on the 1855 hydrographic survey of the Straits of Singapore shown above. This survey, conducted by Captain Samuel Congalton and Government Surveyor John Turnbull Thomson, stands as one of the earliest comprehensive hydrographic surveys of the region carried out by a surveyor based locally. It provides a detailed and valuable portrayal of the geographical characteristics of the Jurong area.

| While the early 19th-century maps of Singapore provided detailed information about the natural features of Jurong, maps from the later half of the 19th century and the early 20th century showed a much smaller boundary for Jurong compared to what we know today. For instance, in this 1885 map of the island of Singapore show above, Jurong was defined by the Pandan River to the south, West Bukit Timah to the north, Upper Tanglin to the east, and Peng Kang to the west. This illustrates how the geographical understanding and delineation of Jurong evolved over time.

| In this 1924 map displaying the mukim numbers of various survey districts in Singapore, Jurong is marked with the mukim number "X" or "10." Since the early 1900s, each land parcel in Singapore has been uniquely identified by a lot number, which consists of two parts: the survey district's Mukim (or Town Subdivision) number and the lot number itself. Singapore is administratively divided into 34 Mukims and 30 Town Subdivisions, and this system helps in locating and organizing land parcels within the country.

### **Peng Kang and Jurong**

During the 19th century, huge tracts of primary forest throughout the island including the Jurong region were cleared to make way for plantations, particularly gambier. The popularity of this cash crop was so significant that Jurong was occasionally called "Peng Kang," a term derived from the practice of boiling gambier leaves. However, it is important to note that Peng Kang is a specific survey district or Mukim located to the west of Jurong, encompassing the areas we now recognise as Jurong West and Boon Lay.

| The name "Peng Keng" (along with Jurong) can be traced back to maps from the early 19th century. For instance, in a 1844 map of Singapore Island surveyed and drawn by Government Surveyor John Turnbull Thomson, "Pengkang" is shown to the west of Sungei Jurong and next to "Joorong," the spelling used for Jurong at the time. This map was created during Thomson's tenure as Government Surveyor, during which he conducted significant surveys, including the allocation and topographical survey of the island and the marine survey of the Straits of Singapore. These early maps provide historical insights into the geographical names and features of the Jurong area.

| During the 19th century, significant portions of primary forests in Peng Keng, along with other parts of the island, were cleared for the establishment of plantations. In a 1855 map of Singapore Island, the plantations in Peng Keng and its surrounding areas, including Tengah (spelled "Tengeh"), Lim Chu Kang, Jurong, and Pandan, were primarily dedicated to the cultivation of gambier and pepper. This map offers a historical snapshot of the dominant crops and land use in these regions during that era.

| The gambier industry saw a decline in the late 1800s, but during the early 1900s, rubber, a new cash crop, gained prominence, largely due to global demand. This shift led to the replacement of gambier estates with rubber plantations, a change exemplified by influential entrepreneurs like Chew Boon Lay. Besides his involvement in rubber, Chew had diverse business interests, including barter trading and the establishment of the Ho Ho Biscuit Factory in 1898. Chew passed away in 1933 and was laid to rest in Bukit Brown Cemetery. Today, his legacy is remembered through the naming of Boon Lay, which is a housing estate, as well as Boon Lay Road and the Boon Lay Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station in his honor.

| While Peng Keng has been renamed Jurong West and Boon Lay, its historical presence can still be observed through Peng Keng Avenue and the forthcoming Peng Keng Hill MRT station along the Jurong Regional Line. Additionally, Peng Keng's survey district number, Mukim VI, which was designated in the early 1900s, continues to be in use today by the Singapore Land Authority, preserving the historical connection of this area to its past name.

### **Communities of Early Jurong**

The deforestation of Jurong and its adjacent areas like Peng Keng attracted new settlers to the region. The majority of these settlers were Chinese, and over time, they established villages in the area. They joined the existing local Malay and Orang Laut communities, who had been residing there, particularly along the coastal areas, even before the arrival of the British.

The Orang Laut were sea and river-based nomadic communities who had been living in Singapore and the surrounding region since at least the 16th century. The British documented some of their tribes or sukus after their arrival, including Orang Biduanda Kallang, Orang Galang, Orang Gelam, Orang Seletar, Orang Selat, and Orang Sembulun. The Orang Sembulun were likely situated in Pulau Samulun, an island off the coast of Jurong at the end of the Jurong River. The image above, a lithograph, shows a canoe with an American flag on its stern approaching huts along the Jurong River bank. It was created by Peter Bernhard Wilhelm Heine, who was part of Commodore Matthew Perry's 1854 expedition to Japan.

In addition to the Orang Laut, the local Malay communities had long been residing along the Jurong River and the coastal areas of Jurong. Although they had distinct cultural backgrounds, the Malays and the Orang Laut shared a mutually beneficial relationship, often serving as the naval forces for various Malay kingdoms. Both communities relied on the resources of the land and sea, engaging in subsistence fishing, collecting plants and fruits from the forest for sustenance and medicinal purposes, and utilizing freshwater streams. The image above is a photograph from the 1950s depicting a fishing village along the Jurong River, illustrating the historical significance of these activities in the region.

The arrival of the British in 1819 led to the influx of new settlers in the Jurong area, primarily from China. These settlers, mainly from the Ann Kway Hokkien community in Anxi county, Fujian Province, took on the challenging task of clearing forests and swamps for the establishment of pepper and gambier plantations, where they later worked as laborers. They were eventually joined by Teochew migrants from Jieyang Province. Both the Hokkiens and Teochews established villages, or kampongs, in the area, with many of these kampongs situated between the 7th and 18th milestone along Jurong Road, one of the oldest roads in western Singapore. An example of such a kampong is Hong Kah Village, captured in the photograph from 1986. Established in the early 1800s, it was originally located at the 12th milestone of Jurong Road. Its name, derived from the Hokkien and Teochew term for "bestowing a religion," also referred to Chinese Christians at the time.

In the early 20th century, numerous factors including the proliferation of rubber plantations, the establishment of British military bases and expansion of the road and transportation network in the rural areas including Jurong saw the growth of existing and new villages. By the end of the 1950s, many of these rural villages were not only equipped with basic facilities and services such as schools, places of worship, markets, provision shops and even clinics. Shown above is the Sin Nan Public School which was established in 1932&nbsp;near Hong Kah Village. Today, the school is located in Jurong West and is known as Xingnan Primary School.
