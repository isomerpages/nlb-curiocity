Littered with villages and crocodile-infested rivers, Jurong used to be nothing more than swampland until then-Finance Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee mooted the idea of turning Jurong into the centre of Singapore’s early industrialisation plans.

It was a risky plan given that Singapore had little experience in creating an industrial town of this size. EDB was tasked to transform Jurong into a hub of factories and industrial activities. This mandate was later passed to Jurong Town Corporation (JTC), which was set up as in 1968.

The project set out to develop a 9,000-acre through land reclamation, resettlement, and infrastructure (roads, power lines, and water) construction.

### **Early Economic Activities in Jurong**

Before the development of the Jurong Industrial Estate, the area was already teeming with a suite of economic activities involving plantations and farms. These not only brought settlers to the area, but also led to the clearing of forest to create lands for the establishment of estates and farms.

| After the British arrived in 1819, a significant portion of Singapore's land was used for growing commercial crops, with the most important ones being pepper, gambier, nutmeg, coconut, pineapple, and rubber. In places like Jurong and others in the western part of the island, including Peng Kang, Choa Chu Kang, and Bukit Timah, the landscape was initially covered with gambier and pepper plantations for most of the 19th century. However, these were later replaced by rubber and pineapple estates in the early 20th century. The prevalence of gambier and pepper plantations in the western and northern parts of Singapore during the 19th century is evident in the 1885 Map of The Island of Singapore and Its Dependencies.

| In contrast to many other parts of Asia where European landowners dominated estate agriculture during that period, most of the rubber plantations in Singapore and Johor were owned by local individuals. Prominent local business leaders who owned rubber estates in Jurong included Chew Boon Lay and Tan Lark Sye. The Sembawang Rubber Plantations Limited company, formed by Lim Boon Keng, Tan Chay Yan, and Lee Choon Guan, also had holdings in the area. Members of the Chettiar community owned estates here, such as Chithambaram Chettiar Estate and Arunachalam Chettiar Estate near Kampong Sungei Jurong. Additionally, there were other rubber holdings in Jurong like the Bajau, Jurong, Lokyang, Yun Nam, Chong Keng, Seng Toh, and Lee Gek Poh estates.

| In the early 20th century, Jurong and its nearby areas emerged as a crucial hub for agricultural production in Singapore. This was due to several reasons, including the growth of vegetable and fruit farms that took over the land previously used by abandoned plantations and disappearing patches of forest. Factors contributing to this development included better road networks into rural areas, the redevelopment of farmlands on the town's outskirts for different purposes, and a rising demand for fresh vegetables, fruits, pork, and poultry driven by the growing population.

| Fishing and prawn farming were also observed along the rivers and coastline of Jurong. These practices had long been associated with the Orang Laut (sea nomads) and Malay settlers in the area, and in the 20th century, fishing farms and prawn ponds experienced substantial growth. Carp farms, known for their high yield, were a popular source of food in Singapore before the war. Additionally, prawn ponds in the muddy river estuaries and mangrove swamps of Jurong were among the largest and most productive on the island. In the 1950s, they covered about 1,000 acres of land and yielded up to 1,000 kilograms of prawns per acre.

| In the early 20th century, while early Jurong was primarily known for its agriculture, several industrial ventures were also established. Starting from the 1920s, the area was home to a number of brickworks that employed somewhat basic techniques. These brickworks used cows or buffaloes to tread on the earth, turning it into a sticky paste. Workers would then shape the bricks by hand before baking them in brick kilns. Before World War II, some of the brickworks in Jurong began using machines in the brick-making process, significantly increasing production. By the 1970s, several prominent brick makers, such as Jurong Brick Works and Ba Gua (Eight Diagrams) Kiln, were operating in the area.

**Why gambier and pepper?**

Gambier is a fast-growing shrub that can be harvested in about 14 months. Its leaves and twigs are boiled and then dried to make a product known as catechu, which contains tannins and catechin. In the early 19th century, catechu was mainly used as an additive in betel quid, where it was combined with lime and wrapped in a betel leaf along with slices of areca nut. Betel chewing was a popular habit in the region during that time. Gambier was often grown alongside pepper, a more profitable crop that takes three years to mature. Pepper plants are vines that need support structures and regular fertilization. The boiled gambier leaves served as valuable fertilizer for the pepper plants, so these two crops were often cultivated together, with gambier providing income while waiting for the pepper vines to bear fruit.

**Why rubber and pineapples?**

As the gambier industry in Singapore declined in the late 1800s, a new cash crop, rubber, started to dominate the plantation landscape, including in Jurong. Rubber was introduced to Singapore and Malaya in 1877 when Henry Ridley brought hevea brasiliensis seeds from Brazil through Kew Gardens in the United Kingdom and planted them in the Botanic Gardens. Chinese plantation owners often grew quick-yielding interim cash crops like pineapples or gambier alongside the rows of rubber trees. These crops generated income within 18 months while the rubber trees matured, as rubber trees took about seven years to mature. To collect rubber latex without harming the trees, cultivators used the herringbone tapping method, which allowed for controlled extraction.

**Kang chu system**

The Chinese plantations were organised under a system led by a headman known as a "kangchu," which translates to "lord of the river" in Teochew. The kangchu oversaw the transformation of virgin jungle areas near river catchments into plantations. These areas were also referred to as "bangsals" (“shed” or “lean-to shelter” in Malay) in reference to the cultivated zones where gambier and pepper were grown as well as the processing facilities and accommodations for the workers within. Typically covering an area of 10 to 50 acres, each bangsal usually employed around 10 workers. These bangsals were situated along major rivers, including the Jurong River, and the settlements of each plantation cluster were known as "Kangkar", which means "foot of the river" in Teochew.

### **Impact on the Landscape of Jurong**

The early economic activities in the Jurong region had a lasting impact on the landscape there. When the British arrived in 1819, the region was covered in thick primary forests. But by the late 1870s, most of the forests had been cleared to make way for plantations.

The vast forests in Jurong and other parts of Singapore were cleared to make room for plantations, particularly for crops like gambier and pepper. Chinese farmers began large-scale cultivation of these crops in the 1830s. They settled in remote river areas in Singapore and initiated the planting of gambier and pepper. They employed a practice known as shifting cultivation, which involved clearing the primary forests to grow their crops. After roughly 15 years, when the soil's fertility declined and local timber and firewood resources were exhausted, they would relocate to new, untouched land to continue their farming.

The expansion of gambier plantations in Singapore can be attributed to several factors, such as relocating the gambier market from Riau to Singapore and eliminating trade taxes on gambier. By the late 1840s, a significant portion of the primary forests in Singapore had been cleared haphazardly, resulting in approximately 400 pepper and gambier plantations across the island. By 1855, Singapore boasted an estimated 12.5 million gambier trees and 1.5 million pepper vines distributed across over 540 documented plantations. This marked a substantial increase, with 27 times more plantations compared to just over 30 years prior.

Deforestation in Singapore continued without any controls until the late 1870s. It was only in 1879 that the colonial government, through John F.A. McNair, assessed the condition of timber forests in the Straits Settlements. McNair's report in 1879 described a dire situation in Singapore, with diminishing timber resources, unregulated deforestation, and a lack of forest protection laws. Despite this alarming report, no immediate action was taken to protect the forests. It wasn't until 1883 when Governor Frederick A. Weld commissioned another report by Nathaniel Cantley, the Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens. Cantley's report reiterated the extensive deforestation in Singapore and the absence of conservation efforts. Finally, the government acted on Cantley's recommendations, leading to the establishment of 12 forest reserves covering approximately 8,000 acres in 1886. Some of these reserves, including Jurong, Pandan, Kranji, and Chan Chu Kang, were situated in Jurong and the western region. These reserves were managed by a Forestry Department within the Botanic Gardens.

Generations of human activities on the island, particularly in the Jurong region, had detrimental effects on the local wildlife. Deforestation, hunting for both sport and sustenance, and the illegal animal trade in Singapore resulted in the decline of various animal species, including tigers. In the first half of the 19th century, the expansion of gambier and pepper plantations increased encounters with tigers because these animals lost their natural prey and the shelter of thick forests. To address this issue, the government started offering rewards for the hunting of tigers. Although this significantly reduced the sighthings of tigers, it eventually led to their eradication in Singapore. The last wild tiger that was hunted down in Singapore took place in 1930 near Choa Chu Kang Village.

The landscape of Jurong was further impacted by the construction of roads and the establishment of small villages with farms. These changes not only improved accessibility to the region but also resulted in the conversion of once undeveloped land into areas for agriculture and residences, playing a crucial role in altering the landscape of Jurong.

### **Developing Jurong as an Industrial Estate**

While the early economic activities had altered the landscape of the Jurong region, there were parts of it especially along the coastal area that were still swamplands and largely undeveloped. But this would change in the early 1960s when Jurong was designated as Singapore's first industrial estate.

https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/88d8e82f-438e-11e4-859c-0050568939ad

The development of Jurong as Singapore's first industrial estate began in 1961. Led by then Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee and Dutch economist Albert Winsemius, the aim of the industrialisation project was to generate employment and economic growth. A 69-square-kilometer area in Jurong was selected for industrial development. To make this vision a reality, low hills were flattened, and swampy areas were reclaimed to prepare the land for various industrial, infrastructural, residential, and recreational purposes.

https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/29491c3c-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad

The Jurong Industrial Estate project began with the laying of the foundation stone for the National Iron & Steel Mills, now known as NatSteel, on 1 September 1962. In its early stages, the estate hosted various industries such as timber, sawmilling, oil-rig fabrication, shipbuilding, and repair. By 1976, the estate was home to 650 factories, and more than 20,000 flats were occupied, marking a significant expansion of industrial and residential activities in the area.

https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b8a4d8a7-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad

The Jurong Industrial Estate's development and administration were initially overseen by the Economic Development Board (EDB). Established in 1961, the EDB's primary role was to encourage foreign companies to establish factories in Jurong by providing industrial financing and incentive packages. By 1967, marking the completion of the first phase of development, the Jurong Industrial Estate had successfully attracted investments amounting to approximately S$178 million in fixed assets and had created employment opportunities for around 6,500 workers.

As Singapore intensified its industrialization efforts after gaining independence on August 9, 1965, it became evident to the government that managing industrial estates would become increasingly intricate and demanding. Consequently, the government made the decision to transfer this responsibility from the Economic Development Board (EDB) to a newly established agency known as Jurong Town Corporation (JTC). In addition to managing and expanding Singapore's industrial estates, JTC was also given the mandate to provide amenities that would enhance the quality of life for those working and residing within these estates.
Goh's folly?


### **Infrastructural Development**

Jurong Port

https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/e0ad2cb8-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad

Jurong Port started its operations in 1965. The natural deep waters in the vicinity of Jurong made it an ideal location for establishing the port. The first wharves were constructed in 1963, enabling the import of raw materials and the export of finished products from the factories in Jurong. The port handled a diverse range of cargo, including steel plates, industrial chemicals, timber, and even farm animals. Over the decades, it went through a series of improvement to expand its capabilities. Presently, the port boasts 32 berths, over 174,000 square meters of warehouse facilities, and can accommodate ships weighing up to 150,000 deadweight tonnes.

Jurong Railway

The Jurong Railway, built in collaboration between the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM), also known as Malayan Railways Limited, served as a transportation route for clinker and timber, primarily from peninsular Malaysia into Jurong, while transporting manufactured products in the opposite direction. This railway operated as a spur line connected to the main Malaysia–Singapore railway, commencing from the Bukit Timah Railway Station near King Albert Park, passing through Pasir Panjang, and concluding at Shipyard Road close to the Mobil refinery. In the mid-1990s, the Jurong Railway was decommissioned due to changing logistics trends and the adoption of more efficient transportation methods.

Jurong Shipyard

To capitalise on the newly established Jurong Industrial Estate and Jurong Port in the early 1960s, Jurong Shipyard was established in April 1963. This shipyard was tasked with the construction, maintenance, and repair of all types of ships and vessels. The establishment of Jurong Shipyard faced its share of challenges ranging from funding to obtaining the know-how. Despite these initial obstacles, the government, in collaboration with Japanese partners, set up the shipyard and went on to develop more at Keppel and Sembawang, thereby enhacing the country's shipbuilding and repair capabilities.

Jurong Fishery Port

The Jurong Fishery Port, established in 1969 at the former Tanjong Balai, to serve as a hub for the handling of fish imports into Singapore. This facility also functions as a marketing distribution center for seafood, featuring a wholesale fish market and various shops for the sale of seafood products. Besides handling fishing vessels from Indonesia and those operating in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Fishery Port also receives seafood via trucks from Malaysia and Thailand, as well as by air from countries including Australia, Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar, Taiwan and Vietnam. 

### **Creating Land for Jurong**

Land reclamation

started mushrooming along the flanks of newly-constructed roads that radiated from the town such as Jurong Road, and they typically comprised plantations growing pepper and gambier were among the most popular cash crops between the 1830s and 1870s. This phase of development was marked by the continually shifting locations of bangsals which were the areas cleared and cultivated with Gambier and Pepper and included the processing facilities and ‘coolie lines’ (accommodation). Usually located along major rivers including Jurong River, there were numerous bangsals within a Kangkar which was the riverine village headquarters for the Kangchu (head man).

Why Jurong?

Jurong Island

From labour-intensive to value-added

### **Development of Industries**

Singapore has been transformed economically, socially, and politically since independence in August 1965. The country’s industrial development strategy evolved from labor intensive in the 1960s, skill intensive in the 1970s, capital intensive in the 1980s, and technology intensive in the 1990s to knowledge and innovation intensive from the 2000s onward. Four industries — electronics, precision engineering, chemicals, and biomedical sciences — have anchored the city’s approach to industrial development.

Manufacturing

In the 1960s, Singapore faced high unemployment and began focusing on creating jobs and boosting its economy through labour-intensive industrialisation. This gave rise to the development of the country's manufacturing sector and the setting up of factories in Jurong to produce goods like clothes, toys, and more. This was a significant shift for Singapore, which had relied on trading since the British established it in 1819. The government, particularly the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Jurong Town Corporation, played essential roles in planning and managing this industrialisation process. By the mid-1970s, manufacturing had become a significant part of the economy, and Singapore actively sought foreign investors to compensate for its limited domestic resources and market.

Electronics

As industrial development gained speed, the government of Singapore aimed to shift from low-cost, labor-intensive industries to higher-value, skilled jobs and businesses by developing technical and business expertise. They actively worked to attract foreign investment from Europe, North Asia, and the United States by positioning Singapore as a global business hub for companies. This led to substantial investments in the emerging electronics industry, particularly high-tech products like computer parts and software. Many multinational companies, including Texas Instruments, Hewlett Packard, SGS (now ST Microelectronics), and NEC, relocated or established research and development activities in Singapore. This shift was so successful that, by the late 1970s, manufacturing had overtaken trading as a significant contributor to the country's economy.

Science

In the 1980s, Singapore responded to rapid globalization with a new economic strategy called the Second Industrial Revolution. This plan aimed to transition the manufacturing sector towards more capital-intensive operations. The government recognized the importance of industrial land and the need to prioritize it. In 1985, Singapore faced its first recession, prompting a shift towards diversifying economic activities. They focused on exportable services and positioned the country as a "total business center," attracting international service corporations in various sectors. The emphasis was on higher value-added industries, and initiatives like the Science Park for research and development and support for local businesses through loans and incentives were introduced to foster growth.

Singapore's connection with the oil industry dates back to 1892 when Marcus Samuel and Company used Pulau Bukom as a storage center for kerosene. This island became a vital hub in the East, supplying the company's other facilities. Shell, as it later became known, entered the refining business in 1961 and it redeveloped its storage centre on Pulau Bukom into a 20,000-barrels-per-day refinery. Shell's commitment paved the way for other companies to follow suit turning Singapore is a major global center for oil refining. 


The country has focused on adding value and building a comprehensive value chain in the chemical industry. A game-changer was the creation of Jurong Island, achieved through a substantial investment in land reclamation, which has become the heart of the chemical industry. This island cluster houses various chemical-related businesses, separates more polluting processes from the main island, and has attracted substantial investments and a large workforce. Emphasizing cluster development is a key economic theme. After the success of Jurong Island, Singapore launched the Jurong Island Version 2.0 initiative in 2010, focusing on research and optimization, including the development of the Jurong Rock Caverns, an underground liquid hydrocarbon storage facility.

Electronics

Shipbuilding

As part of the overall economic strategy in the 1960s, shipbuilding and repair facilities were key components of the port infrastructure. Ship repair facilities for ocean-going vessels, which were limited to the dockyards at Keppel Harbour up until the late-1950s, were inadequate in keeping up with demand as manufacturing output increased. In order to capitalise on the newly formed Jurong Industrial Estate and Jurong Port in the early 1960s, Jurong Shipyard was formed in April 1963 to construct, maintain and repair all types of ships and vessels. The establishment of Jurong Shipyard was not without obstacles, though, as noted by Dr Goh: “Jurong Shipyard had difficulty at the beginning in getting capital from people, many of whom thought the whole idea was quite crazy.” After setting up Jurong Shipyard with Japanese partners, the government went on to develop shipyards at Keppel and Sembawang, and even encouraged the formation of private yards, including the smaller ones at Tanjong Rhu.
