### **Early Economic Activities in Jurong**

Before the development of the Jurong Industrial Estate, the area was already teeming with a suite of economic activities involving plantations and farms. These not only brought settlers to the area, but also led to the clearing of forest to create lands for the establishment of estates and farms.

After the British arrived in 1819, a significant portion of Singapore's land was used for growing commercial crops, with the most important ones being pepper, gambier, nutmeg, coconut, pineapple, and rubber. In places like Jurong and others in the western part of the island, including Peng Kang, Choa Chu Kang, and Bukit Timah, the landscape was initially covered with gambier and pepper plantations for most of the 19th century. However, these were later replaced by rubber and pineapple estates in the early 20th century. The prevalence of gambier and pepper plantations in the western and northern parts of Singapore during the 19th century is evident in the 1885 Map of The Island of Singapore and Its Dependencies.

In contrast to many other parts of Asia where European landowners dominated estate agriculture during that period, most of the rubber plantations in Singapore and Johor were owned by local individuals. Prominent local business leaders who owned rubber estates in Jurong included Chew Boon Lay and Tan Lark Sye. The Sembawang Rubber Plantations Limited company, formed by Lim Boon Keng, Tan Chay Yan, and Lee Choon Guan, also had holdings in the area. Members of the Chettiar community owned estates here, such as Chithambaram Chettiar Estate and Arunachalam Chettiar Estate near Kampong Sungei Jurong. Additionally, there were other rubber holdings in Jurong like the Bajau, Jurong, Lokyang, Yun Nam, Chong Keng, Seng Toh, and Lee Gek Poh estates.

n the early 20th century, Jurong and its nearby areas emerged as a crucial hub for agricultural production in Singapore. This was due to several reasons, including the growth of vegetable and fruit farms that took over the land previously used by abandoned plantations and disappearing patches of forest. Factors contributing to this development included better road networks into rural areas, the redevelopment of farmlands on the town's outskirts for different purposes, and a rising demand for fresh vegetables, fruits, pork, and poultry driven by the growing population.

Fishing and prawn farming were also observed along the rivers and coastline of Jurong. These practices had long been associated with the Orang Laut (sea nomads) and Malay settlers in the area, and in the 20th century, fishing farms and prawn ponds experienced substantial growth. Carp farms, known for their high yield, were a popular source of food in Singapore before the war. Additionally, prawn ponds in the muddy river estuaries and mangrove swamps of Jurong were among the largest and most productive on the island. In the 1950s, they covered about 1,000 acres of land and yielded up to 1,000 kilograms of prawns per acre.

In the early 20th century, while early Jurong was primarily known for its agriculture, several industrial ventures were also established. Starting from the 1920s, the area was home to a number of brickworks that employed somewhat basic techniques. These brickworks used cows or buffaloes to tread on the earth, turning it into a sticky paste. Workers would then shape the bricks by hand before baking them in brick kilns. Before World War II, some of the brickworks in Jurong began using machines in the brick-making process, significantly increasing production. By the 1970s, several prominent brick makers, such as Jurong Brick Works and Ba Gua (Eight Diagrams) Kiln, were operating in the area.

**Why gambier and pepper?**

Gambier is a fast-growing shrub that can be harvested in about 14 months. Its leaves and twigs are boiled and then dried to make a product known as catechu, which contains tannins and catechin. In the early 19th century, catechu was mainly used as an additive in betel quid, where it was combined with lime and wrapped in a betel leaf along with slices of areca nut. Betel chewing was a popular habit in the region during that time. Gambier was often grown alongside pepper, a more profitable crop that takes three years to mature. Pepper plants are vines that need support structures and regular fertilization. The boiled gambier leaves served as valuable fertilizer for the pepper plants, so these two crops were often cultivated together, with gambier providing income while waiting for the pepper vines to bear fruit.

**Why rubber and pineapples?**

As the gambier industry in Singapore declined in the late 1800s, a new cash crop, rubber, started to dominate the plantation landscape, including in Jurong. Rubber was introduced to Singapore and Malaya in 1877 when Henry Ridley brought hevea brasiliensis seeds from Brazil through Kew Gardens in the United Kingdom and planted them in the Botanic Gardens. Chinese plantation owners often grew quick-yielding interim cash crops like pineapples or gambier alongside the rows of rubber trees. These crops generated income within 18 months while the rubber trees matured, as rubber trees took about seven years to mature. To collect rubber latex without harming the trees, cultivators used the herringbone tapping method, which allowed for controlled extraction.

**Kang chu system?**

started mushrooming along the flanks of newly-constructed roads that radiated from the town such as Jurong Road, and they typically comprised plantations growing pepper and gambier were among the most popular cash crops between the 1830s and 1870s. This phase of development was marked by the continually shifting locations of bangsals which were the areas cleared and cultivated with Gambier and Pepper and included the processing facilities and ‘coolie lines’ (accommodation). Usually located along major rivers including Jurong River, there were numerous bangsals within a Kangkar which was the riverine village headquarters for the Kangchu (head man).

### **Impact on the Landscape of Jurong**

The early economic activities in the Jurong region had a lasting impact on the landscape there. When the British arrived in 1819, the region was covered in thick primary forests. But by the late 1870s, most of the forests had been cleared to make way for plantations.

The primary forests in Jurong and other parts of Singapore were cleared because of the growth of plantations, especially those for gambier and pepper. Chinese planters started cultivating these crops on a large scale from the 1830s. They settled in distant river areas in Singapore and began planting gambier and pepper. These planters followed a method called shifting cultivation, where they cleared the primary forest to grow their crops. After about 15 years when the soil lost its nutrients and local timber and firewood were running out, they would move to new, untouched land to continue their farming.

The growth of gambier plantations in Singapore was due to several reasons, like moving the gambier market from Riau to Singapore and removing trade taxes on gambier. By the late 1840s, a lot of the primary forests in Singapore had been cleared without much care, and there were about 400 pepper and gambier plantations all over the island. In 1855, Singapore had around 12.5 million gambier trees and 1.5 million pepper vines in over 540 known plantations. This was 27 times more than the roughly 20 plantations that were there just over 30 years ago.

Deforestation in Singapore went unchecked until the late 1870s when the colonial government assigned John F.A. McNair to evaluate the state of timber forests in the Straits Settlements. McNair's 1879 report painted a bleak picture of Singapore, with dwindling timber, unregulated deforestation, and no forest protection laws. Despite this report, no action was taken to safeguard the forests until 1883 when Governor Frederick A. Weld commissioned another report, this time by Nathaniel Cantley, Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens. Cantley's report highlighted extensive deforestation and a lack of conservation efforts. Finally, the government acted on Cantley's recommendations which led to the establishment of 12 forest reserves totaling about 8,000 acres in 1886. Among those that were in Jurong or within the western region included Jurong, Pandan, Kranji and Chan Chu Kang. These reserves managed by a Forestry Department of the Botanic Gardens.

Generations of human activities on the island and the Jurong region had also caused serious harm to the local wildlife. The destruction of forests, hunting for fun and food, and the illegal animal trade in Singapore led to a decline in many animal species with tigers being one of them. In the 1830s, the growth of gambier and pepper plantations had led to more encounters with tigers, as the latter lost their natural prey and forest protection. Tiger attacks increased in the mid-19th century due to the expansion of gambier and rubber plantations. To address this, the government offered rewards for capturing tigers, which led to a sharp decline in tiger sightings. The last wild tiger in Singapore was shot in 1930 in Choa Chu Kang Village, and this decline was also due to deforestation and the spread of lalang grass.

The landscape of Jurong was further impacted by the construction of roads and the establishment of small villages with farms. These developments not only provided better access to the area but also led to the transformation of previously undeveloped land into agricultural and residential zones, contributing to the changing face of Jurong.

### **The Development of the Jurong Industrial Estate**

While the early economic activities had altered the landscape of the Jurong region, there were parts of it especially along the coastal area that were still swamplands and largely undeveloped. But this would change in the early 1960s when Jurong was designated as Singapore's first industrial estate.


The development of Jurong as the first industrial estate in Singapore was initiated in 1961 with the aim to create jobs and boost the economy. The brainchild behind this industrialisation programme was Dutch economist [Albert Winsemius](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1457_2009-02-11.html).  



A land area of 69 sq km in Jurong was chosen as the site for industrial development. Low hills were levelled and the swampland was filled with soil to prepare the land for industrial, residential and recreational developments.4 Jurong Industrial Estate project, Singapore’s first industrial estate, was kick started with the laying of the foundation stone for the National Iron & Steel Mills (known today as NatSteel) on 1 September 1962. Early industries in the estate included timber, sawmilling, oil-rig fabrication, shipbuilding and repair. By 1976, 650 factories were in operation and more than 20,000 flats occupied.5
