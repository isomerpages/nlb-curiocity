Littered with villages and crocodile-infested rivers, Jurong used to be nothing more than swampland until then-Finance Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee mooted the idea of turning Jurong into the centre of Singapore’s early industrialisation plans.

It was a risky plan given that Singapore had little experience in creating an industrial town of this size. EDB was tasked to transform Jurong into a hub of factories and industrial activities. This mandate was later passed to Jurong Town Corporation (JTC), which was set up as in 1968.

The project set out to develop a 9,000-acre through land reclamation, resettlement, and infrastructure (roads, power lines, and water) construction.

### **Early Economic Activities in Jurong**

Before the development of the Jurong Industrial Estate, the area was already teeming with a suite of economic activities involving plantations and farms. These not only brought settlers to the area, but also led to the clearing of forest to create lands for the establishment of estates and farms.

| After the British arrived in 1819, a significant portion of Singapore's land was used for growing commercial crops, with the most important ones being pepper, gambier, nutmeg, coconut, pineapple, and rubber. In places like Jurong and others in the western part of the island, including Peng Kang, Choa Chu Kang, and Bukit Timah, the landscape was initially covered with gambier and pepper plantations for most of the 19th century. However, these were later replaced by rubber and pineapple estates in the early 20th century. The prevalence of gambier and pepper plantations in the western and northern parts of Singapore during the 19th century is evident in the 1885 Map of The Island of Singapore and Its Dependencies.

| In contrast to many other parts of Asia where European landowners dominated estate agriculture during that period, most of the rubber plantations in Singapore and Johor were owned by local individuals. Prominent local business leaders who owned rubber estates in Jurong included Chew Boon Lay and Tan Lark Sye. The Sembawang Rubber Plantations Limited company, formed by Lim Boon Keng, Tan Chay Yan, and Lee Choon Guan, also had holdings in the area. Members of the Chettiar community owned estates here, such as Chithambaram Chettiar Estate and Arunachalam Chettiar Estate near Kampong Sungei Jurong. Additionally, there were other rubber holdings in Jurong like the Bajau, Jurong, Lokyang, Yun Nam, Chong Keng, Seng Toh, and Lee Gek Poh estates.

| In the early 20th century, Jurong and its nearby areas emerged as a crucial hub for agricultural production in Singapore. This was due to several reasons, including the growth of vegetable and fruit farms that took over the land previously used by abandoned plantations and disappearing patches of forest. Factors contributing to this development included better road networks into rural areas, the redevelopment of farmlands on the town's outskirts for different purposes, and a rising demand for fresh vegetables, fruits, pork, and poultry driven by the growing population.

| Fishing and prawn farming were also observed along the rivers and coastline of Jurong. These practices had long been associated with the Orang Laut (sea nomads) and Malay settlers in the area, and in the 20th century, fishing farms and prawn ponds experienced substantial growth. Carp farms, known for their high yield, were a popular source of food in Singapore before the war. Additionally, prawn ponds in the muddy river estuaries and mangrove swamps of Jurong were among the largest and most productive on the island. In the 1950s, they covered about 1,000 acres of land and yielded up to 1,000 kilograms of prawns per acre.

| In the early 20th century, while early Jurong was primarily known for its agriculture, several industrial ventures were also established. Starting from the 1920s, the area was home to a number of brickworks that employed somewhat basic techniques. These brickworks used cows or buffaloes to tread on the earth, turning it into a sticky paste. Workers would then shape the bricks by hand before baking them in brick kilns. Before World War II, some of the brickworks in Jurong began using machines in the brick-making process, significantly increasing production. By the 1970s, several prominent brick makers, such as Jurong Brick Works and Ba Gua (Eight Diagrams) Kiln, were operating in the area.

**Why gambier and pepper?**

Gambier is a fast-growing shrub that can be harvested in about 14 months. Its leaves and twigs are boiled and then dried to make a product known as catechu, which contains tannins and catechin. In the early 19th century, catechu was mainly used as an additive in betel quid, where it was combined with lime and wrapped in a betel leaf along with slices of areca nut. Betel chewing was a popular habit in the region during that time. Gambier was often grown alongside pepper, a more profitable crop that takes three years to mature. Pepper plants are vines that need support structures and regular fertilization. The boiled gambier leaves served as valuable fertilizer for the pepper plants, so these two crops were often cultivated together, with gambier providing income while waiting for the pepper vines to bear fruit.

**Why rubber and pineapples?**

As the gambier industry in Singapore declined in the late 1800s, a new cash crop, rubber, started to dominate the plantation landscape, including in Jurong. Rubber was introduced to Singapore and Malaya in 1877 when Henry Ridley brought hevea brasiliensis seeds from Brazil through Kew Gardens in the United Kingdom and planted them in the Botanic Gardens. Chinese plantation owners often grew quick-yielding interim cash crops like pineapples or gambier alongside the rows of rubber trees. These crops generated income within 18 months while the rubber trees matured, as rubber trees took about seven years to mature. To collect rubber latex without harming the trees, cultivators used the herringbone tapping method, which allowed for controlled extraction.

**Kang chu system**

The Chinese plantations were organised under a system led by a headman known as a "kangchu," which translates to "lord of the river" in Teochew. The kangchu oversaw the transformation of virgin jungle areas near river catchments into plantations. These areas were also referred to as "bangsals" (“shed” or “lean-to shelter” in Malay) in reference to the cultivated zones where gambier and pepper were grown as well as the processing facilities and accommodations for the workers within. Typically covering an area of 10 to 50 acres, each bangsal usually employed around 10 workers. These bangsals were situated along major rivers, including the Jurong River, and the settlements of each plantation cluster were known as "Kangkar", which means "foot of the river" in Teochew.

### **Impact on the Landscape of Jurong**

The early economic activities in the Jurong region had a lasting impact on the landscape there. When the British arrived in 1819, the region was covered in thick primary forests. But by the late 1870s, most of the forests had been cleared to make way for plantations.

The vast forests in Jurong and other parts of Singapore were cleared to make room for plantations, particularly for crops like gambier and pepper. Chinese farmers began large-scale cultivation of these crops in the 1830s. They settled in remote river areas in Singapore and initiated the planting of gambier and pepper. They employed a practice known as shifting cultivation, which involved clearing the primary forests to grow their crops. After roughly 15 years, when the soil's fertility declined and local timber and firewood resources were exhausted, they would relocate to new, untouched land to continue their farming.

The expansion of gambier plantations in Singapore can be attributed to several factors, such as relocating the gambier market from Riau to Singapore and eliminating trade taxes on gambier. By the late 1840s, a significant portion of the primary forests in Singapore had been cleared haphazardly, resulting in approximately 400 pepper and gambier plantations across the island. By 1855, Singapore boasted an estimated 12.5 million gambier trees and 1.5 million pepper vines distributed across over 540 documented plantations. This marked a substantial increase, with 27 times more plantations compared to just over 30 years prior.

Deforestation in Singapore continued without any controls until the late 1870s. It was only in 1879 that the colonial government, through John F.A. McNair, assessed the condition of timber forests in the Straits Settlements. McNair's report in 1879 described a dire situation in Singapore, with diminishing timber resources, unregulated deforestation, and a lack of forest protection laws. Despite this alarming report, no immediate action was taken to protect the forests. It wasn't until 1883 when Governor Frederick A. Weld commissioned another report by Nathaniel Cantley, the Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens. Cantley's report reiterated the extensive deforestation in Singapore and the absence of conservation efforts. Finally, the government acted on Cantley's recommendations, leading to the establishment of 12 forest reserves covering approximately 8,000 acres in 1886. Some of these reserves, including Jurong, Pandan, Kranji, and Chan Chu Kang, were situated in Jurong and the western region. These reserves were managed by a Forestry Department within the Botanic Gardens.

Generations of human activities on the island, particularly in the Jurong region, had detrimental effects on the local wildlife. Deforestation, hunting for both sport and sustenance, and the illegal animal trade in Singapore resulted in the decline of various animal species, including tigers. In the first half of the 19th century, the expansion of gambier and pepper plantations increased encounters with tigers because these animals lost their natural prey and the shelter of thick forests. To address this issue, the government started offering rewards for the hunting of tigers. Although this significantly reduced the sighthings of tigers, it eventually led to their eradication in Singapore. The last wild tiger that was hunted down in Singapore took place in 1930 near Choa Chu Kang Village.

The landscape of Jurong was further impacted by the construction of roads and the establishment of small villages with farms. These changes not only improved accessibility to the region but also resulted in the conversion of once undeveloped land into areas for agriculture and residences, playing a crucial role in altering the landscape of Jurong.

### **Developing Jurong as an Industrial Estate**

While the early economic activities had altered the landscape of the Jurong region, there were parts of it especially along the coastal area that were still swamplands and largely undeveloped. But this would change in the early 1960s when Jurong was designated as Singapore's first industrial estate.

https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/88d8e82f-438e-11e4-859c-0050568939ad

The development of Jurong as Singapore's first industrial estate began in 1961. Led by then Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee and Dutch economist Albert Winsemius, the aim of the industrialisation project was to generate employment and economic growth. A 69-square-kilometer area in Jurong was selected for industrial development. To make this vision a reality, low hills were flattened, and swampy areas were reclaimed to prepare the land for various industrial, infrastructural, residential, and recreational purposes.

https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/29491c3c-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad

The Jurong Industrial Estate project began with the laying of the foundation stone for the National Iron & Steel Mills, now known as NatSteel, on 1 September 1962. In its early stages, the estate hosted various industries such as timber, sawmilling, oil-rig fabrication, shipbuilding, and repair. By 1976, the estate was home to 650 factories, and more than 20,000 flats were occupied, marking a significant expansion of industrial and residential activities in the area.

https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b8a4d8a7-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad

The Jurong Industrial Estate's development and administration were initially overseen by the Economic Development Board (EDB). Established in 1961, the EDB's primary role was to encourage foreign companies to establish factories in Jurong by providing industrial financing and incentive packages. By 1967, marking the completion of the first phase of development, the Jurong Industrial Estate had successfully attracted investments amounting to approximately S$178 million in fixed assets and had created employment opportunities for around 6,500 workers.

As Singapore intensified its industrialization efforts after gaining independence on August 9, 1965, it became evident to the government that managing industrial estates would become increasingly intricate and demanding. Consequently, the government made the decision to transfer this responsibility from the Economic Development Board (EDB) to a newly established agency known as Jurong Town Corporation (JTC). In addition to managing and expanding Singapore's industrial estates, JTC was also given the mandate to provide amenities that would enhance the quality of life for those working and residing within these estates.
Goh's folly?

Why Jurong?

Jurong Island

From labour-intensive to value-added

Industries

Manufacturing

In the area of manufacturing, Winsemius encouraged the setting up of low-value industries, such as by employing women in factories to produce shirts and pyjamas. This industry had low barriers to entry, as the women had prior experience and sewing machines could easily be rented.45 When EDB opened its first overseas centres in Hong Kong to attract foreign investors to Singapore in the early 1960s, the textile and garment industry had already taken root in Singapore. The prospect of a common Malaysian market attracted Hong Kong garment manufacturers such as Wing Tai Holdings, which stayed on after 1965 to export garments from Singapore, supported by a large quota under the Multi-Fibre Agreement.46,47 The early textile and garment factories (e.g., Pelican Textile) were sited in Jurong Industrial Estate.48

The manufacturing of electronics was another early labour-intensive industry that employed large numbers of unskilled workers. As Dr Goh Keng Swee put it: “The electronic components we make in Singapore probably require less skill than that required by barbers or cooks, consisting mostly of repetitive manual operations.” One of the electronics companies courted by EDB was Texas Instruments from the United States, which set up its manufacturing facility in Kallang Basin Industrial Estate in 1968, employing 1,400 workers

Petrochemical Industry

Apart from manufacturing, shipbuilding and ship repair, the petrochemical industry was another economic pillar that grew Singapore’s fortunes in the 1960s. Port facilities for the petrochemical industry were actually developed as early as 1852 when the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company opened its first coal bunkering pier (forerunner of today’s petroleum refining and bunkering industries) to meet the fuelling demands of its steamships. In 1894, Shell Transport and Trading Company established its oil storage and wharf facilities on Pulau Bukom to serve the Far East, other Asian markets and Australia.66 After the Pioneer Industries Ordinance came into effect in 1959, Shell became the first foreign company to receive a pioneer certificate for its investment to build an oil refinery on Pulau Bukom.6

Electronics

Shipbuilding

As part of the overall economic strategy in the 1960s, shipbuilding and repair facilities were key components of the port infrastructure. Ship repair facilities for ocean-going vessels, which were limited to the dockyards at Keppel Harbour up until the late-1950s, were inadequate in keeping up with demand as manufacturing output increased. In order to capitalise on the newly formed Jurong Industrial Estate and Jurong Port in the early 1960s, Jurong Shipyard was formed in April 1963 to construct, maintain and repair all types of ships and vessels. The establishment of Jurong Shipyard was not without obstacles, though, as noted by Dr Goh: “Jurong Shipyard had difficulty at the beginning in getting capital from people, many of whom thought the whole idea was quite crazy.” After setting up Jurong Shipyard with Japanese partners, the government went on to develop shipyards at Keppel and Sembawang, and even encouraged the formation of private yards, including the smaller ones at Tanjong Rhu.

### **Infrastructural Development in Jurong**

Jurong Port

https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/e0ad2cb8-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad

Jurong Port commenced operations in 1965. The natural deep waters off Jurong were ideal for establishing the port, with the first wharves constructed in 1963 to allow the import of raw materials and the export of finished products from the factories in Jurong. Initially run by EDB with PSA’s assistance, Jurong Port handled an assortment of cargo such as steel plates, industrial chemicals, timber, clinker (a residue of steel mills and furnaces that is used to make cement) and even farm animals. The port eventually came under the charge of the newly established Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) in 1968, and an infrastructure-financing loan package from the Asian Development Bank provided the funding for an expansion during the 1970s. Currently, the port features 32 berths, over 174,000 sq m of warehouse facilities, and can accommodate ships weighing up to 150,000 deadweight tonnes

Jurong Railway

Constructed by EDB with Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM, or Malayan Railways Limited), Jurong Railway was used to transport clinker and timber from peninsular Malaysia into Jurong and bring manufactured products the other way. It ran as a spur from the main Malaysia–Singapore railway, starting from the Bukit Timah Railway Station next to King Albert Park, running through Pasir Panjang, and ending at Shipyard Road near the Mobil refinery. Jurong Railway was eventually made defunct in the mid-1990s due to changing trends in logistics and more efficient methods of transportation.

### **Creating Land for Jurong**

Land reclamation

started mushrooming along the flanks of newly-constructed roads that radiated from the town such as Jurong Road, and they typically comprised plantations growing pepper and gambier were among the most popular cash crops between the 1830s and 1870s. This phase of development was marked by the continually shifting locations of bangsals which were the areas cleared and cultivated with Gambier and Pepper and included the processing facilities and ‘coolie lines’ (accommodation). Usually located along major rivers including Jurong River, there were numerous bangsals within a Kangkar which was the riverine village headquarters for the Kangchu (head man).
