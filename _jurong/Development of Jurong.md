Littered with villages, plantations, swamplands and patches of primary forests, Jurong was largely undeveloped until then-Finance Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee mooted the idea in the early 1960s of turning Jurong into the 9,000-acre industrial estate to spearhead Singapore’s industrialisation plans. Despite being a risky plan given that Singapore had little experience in creating an industrial town of this size, the government pressed ahead. In less than a decade, Jurong was transformed into a hub of factories and industrial activities.

### **Early Economic Activities in Jurong**

Before the development of the Jurong Industrial Estate, the area was already teeming with a suite of economic activities involving plantations and farms. These not only brought settlers to the area, but also led to the clearing of forest to create lands for the establishment of estates and farms.

| After the British arrived in 1819, a significant portion of land on Singapore island was used for growing commercial crops, with the most important ones being pepper, gambier, nutmeg, coconut, pineapple, and rubber. In places like Jurong and others in the western part of the island, including Peng Kang, Choa Chu Kang, and Bukit Timah, the landscape was initially covered with primary forests. However, they were cleared to make way for gambier and pepper plantations for most of the 19th century. These plantations were later replaced by rubber and pineapple estates in the early 20th century. The prevalence of gambier and pepper plantations in the western and northern parts of Singapore during the 19th century is evident in the 1885 Map of The Island of Singapore and Its Dependencies.

| In contrast to many other parts of Asia where European landowners dominated estate agriculture during that period, most of the rubber plantations in Singapore and Johor were owned by local individuals. Prominent local business leaders who owned rubber estates in Jurong included Chew Boon Lay and Tan Lark Sye. The Sembawang Rubber Plantations Limited company, formed by Lim Boon Keng, Tan Chay Yan, and Lee Choon Guan, also had holdings in the area. Members of the Chettiar community owned estates here, such as Chithambaram Chettiar Estate and Arunachalam Chettiar Estate near Kampong Sungei Jurong. Additionally, there were other rubber holdings in Jurong like the Bajau, Jurong, Lokyang, Yun Nam, Chong Keng, Seng Toh, and Lee Gek Poh estates. Some of these estates including Chew Boon Lay's are indicated in this 1945 map of Singapore.

| In the early 20th century, Jurong and its nearby areas emerged as a crucial hub for agricultural production in Singapore. This was due to several reasons, including the growth of vegetable and fruit farms that took over the land previously used by abandoned plantations and disappearing patches of forest. Factors contributing to this development included better road networks into rural areas, the redevelopment of farmlands on the town's outskirts for different purposes, and a rising demand for fresh vegetables, fruits, pork, and poultry driven by the growing population. Shown above is an early 20th century postcard showing a small plot of vegetable farm in rural Singapore.

| Fishing and prawn farming were also observed along the rivers and coastline of Jurong. These practices had long been associated with the Orang Laut (sea nomads) and Malay settlers in the area, and in the 20th century, fishing farms and prawn ponds experienced substantial growth. Carp farms, known for their high yield, were a popular source of food in Singapore before the war. Additionally, prawn ponds in the muddy river estuaries and mangrove swamps of Jurong were among the largest and most productive on the island. In the 1950s, they covered about 1,000 acres of land and yielded up to 1,000 kilograms of prawns per acre.

| In the early 20th century, while early Jurong was primarily known for its agriculture, several industrial ventures were also established. Starting from the 1920s, the area was home to a number of brickworks that employed somewhat basic techniques. These brickworks used cows or buffaloes to tread on the earth, turning it into a sticky paste. Workers would then shape the bricks by hand before baking them in brick kilns. Before World War II, some of the brickworks in Jurong began using machines in the brick-making process, significantly increasing production. By the 1970s, several prominent brick makers, such as Jurong Brick Works and Ba Gua (Eight Diagrams) Kiln, were operating in the area.

**Why gambier and pepper?**

Gambier is a fast-growing shrub that can be harvested in about 14 months. Its leaves and twigs are boiled and then dried to make a product known as catechu, which contains tannins and catechin. In the early 19th century, catechu was mainly used as an additive in betel quid, where it was combined with lime and wrapped in a betel leaf along with slices of areca nut. Betel chewing was a popular habit in the region during that time. Gambier was often grown alongside pepper, a more profitable crop that takes three years to mature. Pepper plants are vines that need support structures and regular fertilization. The boiled gambier leaves served as valuable fertilizer for the pepper plants, so these two crops were often cultivated together, with gambier providing income while waiting for the pepper vines to bear fruit.

**Why rubber and pineapples?**

As the gambier industry in Singapore declined in the late 1800s, a new cash crop, rubber, started to dominate the plantation landscape, including in Jurong. Rubber was introduced to Singapore and Malaya in 1877 when Henry Ridley brought hevea brasiliensis seeds from Brazil through Kew Gardens in the United Kingdom and planted them in the Botanic Gardens. Chinese plantation owners often grew quick-yielding interim cash crops like pineapples or gambier alongside the rows of rubber trees. These crops generated income within 18 months while the rubber trees matured, as rubber trees took about seven years to mature. To collect rubber latex without harming the trees, cultivators used the herringbone tapping method, which allowed for controlled extraction.

**Kang chu system**

The Chinese plantations were organised under a system led by a headman known as a "kangchu," which translates to "lord of the river" in Teochew. The kangchu oversaw the transformation of virgin jungle areas near river catchments into plantations. These areas were also referred to as "bangsals" (“shed” or “lean-to shelter” in Malay) in reference to the cultivated zones where gambier and pepper were grown as well as the processing facilities and accommodations for the workers within. Typically covering an area of 10 to 50 acres, each bangsal usually employed around 10 workers. These bangsals were situated along major rivers, including the Jurong River, and the settlements of each plantation cluster were known as "Kangkar", which means "foot of the river" in Teochew.


### **Developing Jurong as an Industrial Estate**

While the early economic activities had altered the landscape of the Jurong region, there were parts of it especially along the coastal area that were still swamplands and largely undeveloped. But this would change in the early 1960s when Jurong was designated as Singapore's first industrial estate.

| The development of Jurong as Singapore's first industrial estate began in 1961. Led by then Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee and Dutch economist Albert Winsemius, the aim of the industrialisation project was to generate employment and economic growth. A 69-square-kilometer area in Jurong was selected for industrial development. To make this vision a reality, low hills were flattened, and swampy areas were reclaimed to prepare the land for various industrial, infrastructural, residential, and recreational purposes. Shown above is a 1962 photograph of the site of the Jurong Industrial Estate. (Image Credit: [Ministry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/88d8e82f-438e-11e4-859c-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

| The Jurong Industrial Estate project began with the laying of the foundation stone for the National Iron & Steel Mills, now known as NatSteel, on 1 September 1962. Over the course of its development, the estate hosted various industries such as timber, sawmilling, oil-rig fabrication, shipbuilding, and repair. By 1976, the estate was home to 650 factories, and more than 20,000 flats were occupied, marking a significant expansion of industrial and residential activities in the area. Shown above is a 1963 photograph of NatSteel's plant in Jurong.

| The Jurong Industrial Estate's development and administration were initially overseen by the Economic Development Board (EDB). Established in 1961, the EDB's primary role was to encourage foreign companies to establish factories in Jurong by providing industrial financing and incentive packages. By 1967, marking the completion of the first phase of development, the Jurong Industrial Estate had successfully attracted investments amounting to approximately S$178 million in fixed assets and had created employment opportunities for around 6,500 workers. Shown above is an aerial photograph of the Jurong Industrial Estate taken in 1960.

| As Singapore intensified its industrialization efforts after gaining independence on August 9, 1965, it became evident to the government that managing industrial estates would become increasingly intricate and demanding. Consequently, the government made the decision to transfer this responsibility from the Economic Development Board (EDB) to a newly established agency known as Jurong Town Corporation (JTC). In addition to managing and expanding Singapore's industrial estates, JTC was also given the mandate to provide amenities that would enhance the quality of life for those working and residing within these estates. Shown above is a 1975 photograph of Jurong Town Hall which was once the headquarters of the Jurong Town Corporation headquarters.

Goh's folly?


### **Jurong and the Development of Industries in Singapore**

The types of industries that could be found in the Jurong Industrial Estate evolved in tandem with Singapore's industrial development strategy. In general, the strategy underwent five phrases of evolution, starting from labor intensive in the 1960s, followed by skill intensive in the 1970s, capital intensive in the 1980s, technology intensive in the 1990s, and knowledge and innovation intensive from the 2000s onward. Some of the key industries that emerged during this process included manufacturing, electronics, shipbuilding,  petrochemicals, and biomedical sciences.

| In the 1960s, Singapore faced high unemployment and began focusing on creating jobs and boosting its economy through labour-intensive industrialisation. This gave rise to the development of the country's manufacturing sector and the setting up of factories in Jurong to produce goods like clothes, toys, and more. This was a significant shift for Singapore, which had relied on trading since the British established it in 1819. The government, particularly the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Jurong Town Corporation, played essential roles in planning and managing this industrialisation process. By the mid-1970s, manufacturing had become a significant part of the economy, and Singapore actively sought foreign investors to compensate for its limited domestic resources and market. (Image Credit: [Singapore Land Authority collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/29cb075a-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

| As industrial development gained speed, the government of Singapore aimed to shift from low-cost, labor-intensive industries to higher-value, skilled jobs and businesses by developing technical and business expertise. They actively worked to attract foreign investment from Europe, North Asia, and the United States by positioning Singapore as a global business hub for companies. This led to substantial investments in the emerging industries in fields such as precision engineering and electronics for the production of precision products such as camera optics, tool-making and precision machineries, as well as high-tech products like computer parts and software. Many multinational companies, including Rollei, Aiwa, Texas Instruments and NEC, relocated or established research and development activities in Singapore.

| In the 1980s, Singapore responded to rapid globalisation with a new economic strategy called the Second Industrial Revolution. This plan aimed to transition the manufacturing sector towards more capital-intensive operations. The government recognised the importance of industrial land and the need to prioritize it. In 1985, Singapore experienced its first recession, prompting the government to recognise the need for economic diversification. They initiated a second engine of growth by positioning the city-state as a "total business center", combining industry expertise with strategic business relationships. This aimed to attract international service corporations in various sectors like finance, education, lifestyle, medicine, information technology, and software. There was also a stronger focus on higher value-added industries at all levels. Notable initiatives included the establishment of the Science Park near the National University of Singapore to stimulate private sector research and development. Additionally, local businesses were encouraged to expand with the help of loans and incentives, promoting economic growth and innovation.

| Singapore's connection with the oil and oil refining industry dates back to 1892 when Marcus Samuel and Company used Pulau Bukom as a storage center for kerosene. This island became a vital hub in the East, supplying the company's other facilities. Shell, as it later became known, entered the refining business in 1961 and it redeveloped its storage centre on Pulau Bukom into a 20,000-barrels-per-day refinery. Shell's commitment paved the way for other companies to follow suit turning Singapore is a major global center for oil refining.

| Jurong is also the stage for the development of the country's petrochemical industry. A game-changer was the creation of Jurong Island, achieved through a substantial investment in land reclamation, which has become the heart of Singapore's petrochemical industry. This island cluster houses various petrochemical-related businesses, separates more polluting processes from the main island, and has attracted substantial investments and a large workforce. Emphasizing cluster development is a key economic theme. After the success of Jurong Island, Singapore launched the Jurong Island Version 2.0 initiative in 2010, focusing on research and optimization, including the development of the Jurong Rock Caverns, an underground liquid hydrocarbon storage facility.

| As part of the overall economic strategy in the 1960s, shipbuilding and repair industry were also identified as one of the essential components of the country's industrialisation process. To take advantage of the newly established Jurong Industrial Estate and Jurong Port in the early 1960s, the government established Jurong Shipyard in April 1963. This new facility was tasked with constructing, maintaining, and repairing various types of ships and vessels. Following the formation of Jurong Shipyard, the government also moved forward to develop shipyards at Keppel and Sembawang. Over the next 40 years, Singapore's marine industry has grown from a small regional ship repair and building center into a global leader. This industry includes ship repair, shipbuilding, rig building, and offshore engineering, along with various supporting services. Singapore is now renowned as a top ship repair and conversion center, a leader in jack-up rig building, and a builder of custom and specialised vessels.

During the 1990s, the Singaporean government launched the Strategic Economic Plan, aiming to attain first-tier developed country status in the next 30 to 40 years. A central element of this plan was creating a research and development environment to make Singapore a knowledge-based and innovation-driven nation. In 1991, the National Science and Technology Board was established, focusing on applied research. It evolved into the Agency of Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR) in 2002, expanding its role to include research and development and human capital training through local and overseas PhD scholarships. Two research-oriented councils were also established: the Biomedical Research Council, which oversaw biomedical research in the public sector, and the Science and Engineering Research Council, which had a similar role in physical sciences and engineering.

In the 1980s, Singapore responded to rapid globalisation with the Second Industrial Revolution, shifting its manufacturing sector toward more capital-intensive operations and diversifying the economy. This included positioning Singapore as a "total business center" to attract international service corporations in various sectors like finance, education, lifestyle, medicine, information technology, and software. The 1990s saw the government's Strategic Economic Plan, striving to achieve first-tier developed country status by creating a knowledge-based and innovation-driven nation. This involved establishing the National Science and Technology Board, later becoming A\*STAR, to focus on research and development and human capital training for this drive. 

In additional, science park

Singapore's biomedical sciences initiative, launched in 2000, transformed the industry into a significant economic pillar. By 2013, it contributed 8.2% to the GDP, second only to electronics. The initiative focuses on pharmaceuticals and medical technology, with Tuas Biomedical Park attracting international pharmaceutical companies. It also aimed to encourage industry research and startups in four areas: pharmaceuticals, medical technology, healthcare services, and biotechnology. Publicly funded research institutes were created to develop capabilities in various fields. The initiative progressed through three phases: core research capabilities, translating research into clinical applications, and commercialization and partnerships with industry. It supports startups with financing and co-investment, leading to the growth of around 40 local medical technology companies.

Quote:

The establishment of Jurong Shipyard was not without obstacles, though, as noted by Dr Goh: “Jurong Shipyard had difficulty at the beginning in getting capital from people, many of whom thought the whole idea was quite crazy.”

| Jurong Port started its operations in 1965. The natural deep waters in the vicinity of Jurong made it an ideal location for establishing the port. The first wharves were constructed in 1963, enabling the import of raw materials and the export of finished products from the factories in Jurong. The port handled a diverse range of cargo, including steel plates, industrial chemicals, timber, and even farm animals. Over the decades, it went through a series of improvement to expand its capabilities. Presently, the port boasts 32 berths, over 174,000 square meters of warehouse facilities, and can accommodate ships weighing up to 150,000 deadweight tonnes.

| The Jurong Railway, built in collaboration between the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM), also known as Malayan Railways Limited, served as a transportation route for clinker and timber, primarily from peninsular Malaysia into Jurong, while transporting manufactured products in the opposite direction. This railway operated as a spur line connected to the main Malaysia–Singapore railway, commencing from the Bukit Timah Railway Station near King Albert Park, passing through Pasir Panjang, and concluding at Shipyard Road close to the Mobil refinery. In the mid-1990s, the Jurong Railway was decommissioned due to changing logistics trends and the adoption of more efficient transportation methods.

This shipyard was tasked with the construction, maintenance, and repair of all types of ships and vessels. The establishment of Jurong Shipyard faced its share of challenges ranging from funding to obtaining the know-how. Despite these initial obstacles, the government, in collaboration with Japanese partners, set up the shipyard and went on to develop more at Keppel and Sembawang, thereby enhacing the country's shipbuilding and repair capabilities.

| The Jurong Fishery Port, established in 1969 at the former Tanjong Balai, to serve as a hub for the handling of fish imports into Singapore. This facility also functions as a marketing distribution center for seafood, featuring a wholesale fish market and various shops for the sale of seafood products. Besides handling fishing vessels from Indonesia and those operating in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Fishery Port also receives seafood via trucks from Malaysia and Thailand, as well as by air from countries including Australia, Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar, Taiwan and Vietnam.

| The development of Jurong as an industrial estate in Singapore included the construction of roads, with more than 30 thoroughfares built within the first decade of its development to connect factories to port facilities, housing estates, and the rest of the island. Interestingly, these new roads were given names that reflected themes of "industry" and "progress". For example, on the 1972 street map of Jurong, you could find roads with names like Corporation Road, Enterprise Road, Quality Road, Tractor Road, Fan Yoong Road (which means "Prosperity" Road in Chinese), Jalan Pesawat (or "Machinery" Road in Malay), or Neythal Road (or "Weaving" Road in Tamil, possibly referring to the presence of textile factories along the road). These names symbolised the industrial and economic growth taking place in Jurong.
