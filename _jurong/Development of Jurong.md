Early Economic Activites in Jurong

Following the arrival of the British in 1819, large swathes of land in Singapore had been used for the cultivation of commercial crops - the most important of which were pepper, gambier, nutmeg, coconut, pineapple and rubber. In Jurong as well as others in the western part of the island including Peng Kang, Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Timah, the landscape was initially dotted with gambier and pepper plantations during most of the 19th century before they were replaced by rubber and pineapple estates in the early 20th century.

The early 20th century also saw Jurong and its surrounding areas became an important centre of agricultural production for Singapore as there was a proliferation of vegetable and fruit farms there, taking over the land freed up by abandoned plantations as well as the quickly vanishing patches of forest. This development was brought about by numerous factors including improvements made to the road network into the rural areas, farmlands around the fringe of the town being redeveloped for other uses, and an increase demand for fresh vegetables, fruits, pork and poultry following the steady growth of the population.

started mushrooming along the flanks of newly-constructed roads that radiated from the town such as Jurong Road, and they typically comprised plantations growing pepper and gambier were among the most popular cash crops between the 1830s and 1870s. This phase of development was marked by the continually shifting locations of bangsals which were the areas cleared and cultivated with Gambier and Pepper and included the processing facilities and ‘coolie lines’ (accommodation). Usually located along major rivers including Jurong River, there were numerous bangsals within a Kangkar which was the riverine village headquarters for the Kangchu (head man).
