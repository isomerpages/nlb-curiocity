### **Early Economic Activities in Jurong**

Before the development of the Jurong Industrial Estate, the area was already teeming with a suite of economic activities involving plantations and farms. These not only brought settlers to the area, but also led to the clearing of forest to create lands for the establishment of estates and farms.

Following the arrival of the British in 1819, large swathes of land in Singapore had been used for the cultivation of commercial crops - the most important of which were pepper, gambier, nutmeg, coconut, pineapple and rubber. In Jurong as well as others in the western part of the island including Peng Kang, Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Timah, the landscape was initially dotted with gambier and pepper plantations during most of the 19th century before they were replaced by rubber and pineapple estates in the early 20th century. The prominence of gambier and pepper plantations in the western as well as the northern regions of Singapore during the 19th century can be seen in the above 1885 Map of The Island of Singapore and Its Dependencies.

Unlike estate agriculture elsewhere in Asia at the time, which was largely dominated by Europeans, almost all of the rubber plantations in Singapore and Johor were owned by locals. Prominent business leaders who owned rubber estates in Jurong included Chew Boon Lay and Tan Lark Sye, and the Sembawang Rubber Plantations Limited company formed by Lim Boon Keng, Tan Chay Yan and Lee Choon Guan had holdings in the area. Members of the Chettiar community also owned estates here, including Chithambaram Chettiar Estate and Arunachalam Chettiar Estate near Kampong Sungei Jurong at the head of the river. Other rubber holdings in Jurong included the Bajau, Jurong, Lokyang, Yun Nam, Chong Keng, Seng Toh and Lee Gek Poh estates. The islands of Pulau Pesek, Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Merlimau, Pulau Seraya and Pulau Samulun also featured extensive rubber and pineapple cultivation alongside their kampongs, but there is little indication of their ownership.

The early 20th century also saw Jurong and its surrounding areas became an important centre of agricultural production for Singapore as there was a proliferation of vegetable and fruit farms there, taking over the land freed up by abandoned plantations as well as the quickly vanishing patches of forest. This development was brought about by numerous factors including improvements made to the road network into the rural areas, farmlands around the fringe of the town being redeveloped for other uses, and an increase demand for fresh vegetables, fruits, pork and poultry following the steady growth of the population.

Fishing and prawn farming were also dominant around the rivers and coastline of Jurong. An activity that had been long associated with the Orang Laut and Malay settlers there, the 20th century saw the growth of fishing farms and prawn ponds. In fact, the high-yielding carp farms were a popular food in Singapore before the war, while the prawn ponds in the muddy river estuaries and mangrove swamps of Jurong were among the biggest and most productive on the island, yielding to some 1,000 acres and up to 1,000 kilograms of prawns per acre during the 1950s.

While early Jurong was mainly known for its agricultural character, there were a number of industrial ventures established from the early 20th century. Since at least the 1920s, a number of brickworks operated in the area using rather rudimentary methods The brickworks used cows or buffaloes to step on earth, turning it into a gluey paste. This was then hand-shaped by workers, before being baked in brick kilns. Before World War II, brickworks in Jurong began using machines in the brick making process, greatly boosting production numbers. By the 1970s, there were a number of prominent brick makers including s, Jurong Brick Works and Ba Gua (Eight Diagrams) Kiln.

**Why gambier and pepper?**

Gambier is a fast-growing shrub whose foliage can be harvested in about 14 months. The leaves and twigs are first boiled and the resulting paste is then dried. The final product, popularly called catechu, contains both tannins and catechin. In the early 19th century, catechu was mainly used as an additive in the betel quid. The catechu and lime were smeared on the betel leaf (known locally as sireh), which was then wrapped around small slices of areca nut. Betel chewing was a habit that was popular in the region at the time. Commonly grown alongside gambier is pepper. Although pepper was a much more profitable crop, the plant takes three years before it can be harvested. Additionally, the pepper plant is a vine that requires frames for support to grow upwards and also needs to be fertilised regularly. The boiled gambier leaves provide much-needed fertiliser for pepper plants which is why the two crops are often grown together; gambier would be planted while waiting for the pepper vines to start bearing fruits.

**Why rubber and pineapples?**

With the gambier industry in Singapore waning in the late 1800s, a new cash crop began to dominate the plantation landscape, including in Jurong. This was rubber, introduced to Singapore and Malaya in 1877 after Henry Ridley brought hevea brasiliensis seeds from Brazil via Kew Gardens in the United Kingdom and planted them in the Botanic Gardens. The Chinese often planted interim cash crops such as pineapple or gambier among the rows of rubber trees, and these crops that yielded their produce within 18 months generated cash flow while the rubber trees matured. A rubber tree required a maturation period of seven years and the herringbone method of tapping was used by its cultivators to extract the rubber latex in a controlled fashion without killing the tree. 

**Kang chu system?**

started mushrooming along the flanks of newly-constructed roads that radiated from the town such as Jurong Road, and they typically comprised plantations growing pepper and gambier were among the most popular cash crops between the 1830s and 1870s. This phase of development was marked by the continually shifting locations of bangsals which were the areas cleared and cultivated with Gambier and Pepper and included the processing facilities and ‘coolie lines’ (accommodation). Usually located along major rivers including Jurong River, there were numerous bangsals within a Kangkar which was the riverine village headquarters for the Kangchu (head man).
