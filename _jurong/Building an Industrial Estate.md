Littered with villages, plantations, swamplands and patches of primary forests, Jurong was largely undeveloped until then-Finance Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee mooted the idea in the early 1960s of turning Jurong into the 9,000-acre industrial estate to spearhead Singapore’s industrialisation plans. Despite being a risky plan given that Singapore had little experience in creating an industrial town of this size, the government pressed ahead. In less than a decade, Jurong was transformed into a hub of factories and industrial activities.

### **Early Economic Activities in Jurong**

Before the development of the Jurong Industrial Estate, the area was already teeming with a suite of economic activities involving plantations and farms. These not only brought settlers to the area, but also led to the clearing of forests to create lands for the establishment of estates and farms.

| After the British arrived in 1819, a significant portion of land on Singapore island was used for growing commercial crops, with the most important ones being pepper, gambier, nutmeg, coconut, pineapple, and rubber. In places like Jurong and others in the western part of the island, including Peng Kang, Choa Chu Kang, and Bukit Timah, the landscape was initially covered with primary forests. However, they were cleared to make way for gambier and pepper plantations for most of the 19th century. These plantations were later replaced by rubber and pineapple estates in the early 20th century. The prevalence of gambier and pepper plantations in the western and northern parts of Singapore during the 19th century is evident in the 1885 Map of The Island of Singapore and Its Dependencies.

| In contrast to many other parts of Asia where European landowners dominated estate agriculture during that period, most of the rubber plantations in Singapore and Johor were owned by local individuals. Prominent local business leaders who owned rubber estates in Jurong included Chew Boon Lay and Tan Lark Sye. The Sembawang Rubber Plantations Limited company, formed by Lim Boon Keng, Tan Chay Yan, and Lee Choon Guan, also had holdings in the area. Members of the Chettiar community owned estates here, such as Chithambaram Chettiar Estate and Arunachalam Chettiar Estate near Kampong Sungei Jurong. Additionally, there were other rubber holdings in Jurong like the Bajau, Jurong, Lokyang, Yun Nam, Chong Keng, Seng Toh, and Lee Gek Poh estates. Some of these estates including Chew Boon Lay's are indicated in this 1945 map of Singapore.

| In the early 20th century, Jurong and its nearby areas emerged as a crucial hub for agricultural production in Singapore. This was due to several reasons, including the growth of vegetable and fruit farms that took over the land previously used by abandoned plantations and disappearing patches of forest. Factors contributing to this development included better road networks into rural areas, the redevelopment of farmlands on the town's outskirts for different purposes, and a rising demand for fresh vegetables, fruits, pork, and poultry driven by the growing population. Shown above is an early 20th century postcard showing a small plot of vegetable farm in a rural village in Singapore.

| ![Jurong early fishing photograph](/images/Jurongdigital/jurong_early_economy_image_2.jpg)|
| Fishing and prawn farming were also observed along the rivers and coastline of Jurong. These practices had long been associated with the Orang Laut (sea nomads) and Malay settlers in the area, and in the 20th century, fishing farms and prawn ponds experienced substantial growth. Carp farms, known for their high yield, were a popular source of food in Singapore before the war. Additionally, prawn ponds in the muddy river estuaries and mangrove swamps of Jurong were among the largest and most productive on the island. In the 1950s, they covered about 1,000 acres of land and yielded up to 1,000 kilograms of prawns per acre. Shown above is a 1955 photograph of a man casting a net to catch prawns in Singapore.

| ![Jurong bricks](/images/Jurongdigital/jurong_early_economy_image_3.jpg)|
| In the early 20th century, while early Jurong was primarily known for its agriculture, several industrial ventures were also established. Starting from the 1920s, the area was home to a number of brickworks that employed somewhat basic techniques. These brickworks used cows or buffaloes to tread on the earth, turning it into a sticky paste. Workers would then shape the bricks by hand before baking them in brick kilns. Before World War II, some of the brickworks in Jurong began using machines in the brick-making process, significantly increasing production. By the 1970s, several prominent brick makers, such as Jurong Brick Works and Ba Gua (Eight Diagrams) Kiln, were operating in the area.

With the revenue from these interim crops, and smaller capital investments in their rubber plantations than that of their European counterparts, it cost Chinese planters around 150 Straits dollars per acre of their rubber estate. This was in contrast to European estates that could require up to four times the capital investment. (p. 14)"</span>

### **Building an Industrial Estate**

While the early economic activities had altered the landscape of the Jurong region, there were parts of it especially along the coastal area that were still swamplands and largely undeveloped. But this would change in the early 1960s when Jurong was designated as Singapore's first industrial estate.


|   | 
|:--------:| 
| ![Jurong industrial estate early photograph](/images/Jurongdigital/jurong_industrial_estate_image_1.jpg)|
| The development of Jurong as Singapore's first industrial estate began in 1961. Led by then Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee and Dutch economist Albert Winsemius, the aim of the industrialisation project was to generate employment and economic growth. A 69-square-kilometer area in Jurong was selected for industrial development. To make this vision a reality, low hills were flattened, and swampy areas were reclaimed to prepare the land for various industrial, infrastructural, residential, and recreational purposes. Shown above is a 1962 photograph of the site of the Jurong Industrial Estate. (Image Credit: [Ministry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/88d8e82f-438e-11e4-859c-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |
| ![Natsteel photograph](/images/Jurongdigital/jurong_industrial_estate_image_2.jpg)|
| The Jurong Industrial Estate project began with the laying of the foundation stone for the National Iron &amp; Steel Mills, now known as NatSteel, on 1 September 1962. Over the course of its development, the estate hosted various industries such as timber, sawmilling, oil-rig fabrication, shipbuilding, and repair. By 1976, the estate was home to 650 factories, and more than 20,000 flats were occupied, marking a significant expansion of industrial and residential activities in the area. Shown above is a 1963 photograph of NatSteel's plant in Jurong.

| The Jurong Industrial Estate's development and administration were initially oversaw by the Economic Development Board (EDB). Established in 1961, the EDB's primary role was to encourage foreign companies to establish factories in Jurong by providing industrial financing and incentive packages. By 1967, marking the completion of the first phase of development, the Jurong Industrial Estate had successfully attracted investments amounting to approximately S$178 million in fixed assets and had created employment opportunities for around 6,500 workers.

| ![JTC building black and white](/images/Jurongdigital/jurong_industrial_estate_image_4.jpg)|
| As Singapore intensified its industrialisation efforts after gaining independence on August 9, 1965, it became evident to the government that managing industrial estates would become increasingly intricate and demanding. Consequently, the government made the decision to transfer this responsibility from the Economic Development Board (EDB) to a newly established agency known as Jurong Town Corporation (JTC). In addition to managing and expanding Singapore's industrial estates, JTC was also given the mandate to provide amenities that would enhance the quality of life for those working and residing within these estates. Shown above is a 1975 photograph of Jurong Town Hall which was once the headquarters of the Jurong Town Corporation headquarters.

<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">"[T]he new PAP Government has invited a UNDP committee to come and advise us about economic development, particularly in Jurong where a big area is covered by swamps. The UNDP team produced a report and submitted to Minister for Finance.
<br>
<br>In fact, all these were prompted and initiated by Dr Goh [Keng Swee]. His whole idea of the new Government is that we must embark on economic development in order to alleviate two very important strategies. One is that we are no more going to depend purely on trade or as a trading city. We have to embark on our own economic development rather than purely on trade. Secondly, being a small country, we have to make good use of whatever land that we have so as to turn it into productive enterprises.
<br>
<br>So the UNDP committee came and submitted a report of how to turn Jurong, hitherto a swamp, into an industrial estate. The report was submitted to Government. Dr Goh has appointed Mr Hon Sui Sen (at that time he's Head of EDB) to form a committee to look into the feasibility of this report.
<br>
<br>Well, the early problem of JTC is to fill up all the swamps into land capable of sustaining the building works. That's the main task of JTC during the early years. It's purely reclamation and filling up the swamps and turning it [for] land use. After that, then JTC started building standard factory buildings and invited local entrepreneurs to start their industry in Singapore. I think the early problem is purely providing infrastructures for all the interested companies to set up there.
<br>
<br>I think the EDB has done a very good job in promoting this industrial estate to all the local entrepreneurs and multi-national firms. I think they managed to get most of these people interested. The Corporation, I think, started very well when all these enterprises and industries were ensured that their enterprises will receive Government assistance. Various incentives were given to them to start their work. For one thing, their starting capital expenditure will be very much less. They have got ready infrastructures for their enterprise. They have got a ready factory to start their work. So as far as capital cost is concerned, that helps them to start their business with the least capital expenses. And they are ensured of all sorts of incentives given by the EDB to establish their industries in Jurong. I think the public has very good response to these Government-promoted projects.”</span>

### **Building Industries**

The types of industries that could be found in the Jurong Industrial Estate evolved in tandem with Singapore's industrial development strategy. In general, the strategy underwent five phrases of evolution, starting from labor intensive in the 1960s, followed by skill intensive in the 1970s, capital intensive in the 1980s, technology intensive in the 1990s, and knowledge and innovation intensive from the 2000s onward. Some of the key industries that emerged during this process included manufacturing, electronics, shipbuilding,  petrochemicals, and biomedical sciences.

|:--------:| 
| ![Pelican Textiles Factory](/images/Jurongdigital/jurong_industries_1.jpg)|
| In the 1960s, Singapore faced high unemployment and began focusing on creating jobs and boosting its economy through labour-intensive industrialisation. This gave rise to the development of the country's manufacturing sector and the setting up of factories in Jurong to produce goods like clothes, toys, and more. This was a significant shift for Singapore, which had relied on trading since the British established it in 1819. The government, particularly the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Jurong Town Corporation, played essential roles in planning and managing this industrialisation process. By the mid-1970s, manufacturing had become a significant part of the economy, and Singapore actively sought foreign investors to compensate for its limited domestic resources and market. Shown above is a 1964 photograph of the Pelican Textiles Factory in Jurong. (Image Credit: [Ministry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/29cb075a-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |
| ![Jurong Shipyard](/images/Jurongdigital/jurong_industries_2.jpg)|
| As part of the overall economic strategy in the 1960s, shipbuilding and repair industry were also identified as one of the essential components of the country's industrialisation process. To take advantage of the newly established Jurong Industrial Estate and Jurong Port in the early 1960s, the government established Jurong Shipyard in April 1963. This new facility was tasked with constructing, maintaining, and repairing various types of ships and vessels. Following the formation of Jurong Shipyard, the government also moved forward to develop shipyards at Keppel and Sembawang. Over the next 40 years, Singapore's marine industry has grown from a small regional ship repair and building center into a global leader. This industry includes ship repair, shipbuilding, rig building, and offshore engineering, along with various supporting services. Singapore is now renowned as a top ship repair and conversion center, a leader in jack-up rig building, and a builder of custom and specialised vessels. Shown above is a photograph of Jurong Shipyard taken during the initiation ceremony of its drydock in 1968. (Image Credit: [Ministry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/cd1cb13f-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |
| ![Jurong Island](/images/Jurongdigital/jurong_industries_3.jpg)|
| Jurong is also the stage for the development of the country's petrochemical industry. A game-changer was the creation of Jurong Island, achieved through a substantial investment in land reclamation, which has become the heart of Singapore's petrochemical industry. This island cluster houses various petrochemical-related businesses, separates more polluting processes from the main island, and has attracted substantial investments and a large workforce. Emphasizing cluster development is a key economic theme. After the success of Jurong Island, Singapore launched the Jurong Island Version 2.0 initiative in 2010, focusing on research and optimization, including the development of the Jurong Rock Caverns, an underground liquid hydrocarbon storage facility. Above is a 1999 photograph showing the land reclamation works at Jurong Island.

| ![Oil refinery at Pulau Bukom](/images/Jurongdigital/jurong_industries_4.jpg)|
| Singapore's connection with the oil and oil refining industry dates back to 1892 when Marcus Samuel and Company used Pulau Bukom as a storage center for kerosene. This island became a vital hub in the East, supplying the company's other facilities. Shell, as it later became known, entered the refining business in 1961 and it redeveloped its storage centre on Pulau Bukom into a 20,000-barrels-per-day refinery. Shell's commitment paved the way for other companies to follow suit turning Singapore is a major global center for oil refining. Above is a 1960 photograph showing the oil refinery at Pulau Bukom.

| ![Aiwa's manufacturing plant](/images/Jurongdigital/jurong_industries_5.jpg)|
| As industrial development gained speed in the 1970s, the government of Singapore started to shift from low-cost, labor-intensive industries to higher-value, skilled jobs and businesses by developing technical and business expertise. They actively worked to attract foreign investment from Europe, North Asia, and the United States by positioning Singapore as a global business hub for companies. This led to substantial investments in the emerging industries in fields such as precision engineering and electronics for the production of precision products such as camera optics,&nbsp;tool-making&nbsp;and precision machineries, as well as high-tech products like computer parts and software. Many multinational companies, including Rollei, Aiwa, Texas Instruments and NEC, relocated or established research and development activities in Singapore. Above is a 1987 photograph showing the then Labour Minister Lee Yock Suan being briefed by an official during his tour of Aiwa's manufacturing plant in Jurong.

| ![Automation Applications Centre of Robot Leasing and Consultancy Pte Ltd](/images/Jurongdigital/jurong_industries_6.jpg)|
| In the 1980s, Singapore continued to focus on diversifying its economy and transitioning its manufacturing sector to be more capital-intensive. Simultaneously, it started to position itself as a global business hub to attract international service corporations in finance, education, lifestyle, medicine, information technology, and software. In the 1990s, Singapore continued to diversify and advance its economy, with the introduction of the Strategic Economic Plan. This plan aimed to transform Singapore into a first-tier developed country by turning it into a knowledge-based and innovation-driven nation. To achieve this, a number of initiatives were taken. These included the establishment of the Science Park beside the National University of Singapore and the formation of the National Science and Technology Board. Later renamed A\*STAR, this agency was tasked to focus on conducting, funding and attracting experts to drive research and development activities, as well as to conduct and support human capital training. Shown above is 1985 photograph of a mechanical robot at the Automation Applications Centre of Robot Leasing and Consultancy Pte Ltd in Science Park.

| ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/jurong-development-industries-image-7-1.jpg)|
| From the 2000s, Singapore initiated the development of its biomedical science industry with the aim to turn it into a key economic pillar. A focus of this initiative centered on development of pharmaceuticals and medical technology and products. To aid this process, the Tuas Biomedical Park was established and it served as a node to attract major international pharmaceutical companies. In additional, publicly funded research institutes were also established to enhance capabilities in fields related to the biomedical industry. Similarly, financial support was also given tto promote industry research and startups in related areas such as pharmaceuticals, medical technology, healthcare services, and biotechnology.

The Economic Development Board started with $100 million, its capital spread over five years, $20 million each year. The $40 million was a lot of money. And I think this earth slip set us back $10 million to $15 million. That was a major technical problem.
<br>
<br>At that stage it was crucial. The Government had to give a lead to set up the Economic Development Board to start with; established the Jurong industrial estate which was in the beginning under the EDB, to provide finance to companies to do the promotion. Those were all critical areas that accelerated the development process.
<br>
<br>But I think we should also remind ourselves what were the fundamentals in terms of political and social stability and macro-economic stability. In other words, balanced budgets and a strong currency and so on. But we didn't, of course, start with political and social stability in the early sixties. There was still a good bit of industrial strife and a good bit of political struggle in Parliament and outside Parliament. But we did maintain macro-economic stability. That must have been crucial. We didn't spend beyond our means and we retained the internal and external value of the Singapore dollar, particularly the internal value. Inflation was very low.”</span>

### **Building Infrastructure**

The provision of infrastructure is integral to the development of any estate, whether it's for commercial, housing, or industrial purposes, as it facilitates not only the movement of goods and workers but also the supply of electricity, water, and gas. Consequently, there was a boom in infrastructural works in Jurong as it was being developed into an industrial estate. These works included the construction of a port, a railway, a road network, and even a fishery port.

| Jurong Port started its operations in 1965. The natural deep waters in the vicinity of Jurong made it an ideal location for establishing the port. The first wharves were constructed in 1963, enabling the import of raw materials and the export of finished products from the factories in Jurong. The port handled a diverse range of cargo, including steel plates, industrial chemicals, timber, and even farm animals. Over the decades, it went through a series of improvement to expand its capabilities. Presently, the port boasts 32 berths, over 174,000 square meters of warehouse facilities, and can accommodate ships weighing up to 150,000 deadweight tonnes.

| The Jurong Railway, built in collaboration between the Economic Development Board (EDB) and Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM), also known as Malayan Railways Limited, served as a transportation route for clinker and timber, primarily from peninsular Malaysia into Jurong, while transporting manufactured products in the opposite direction. This railway operated as a spur line connected to the main Malaysia–Singapore railway, commencing from the Bukit Timah Railway Station near King Albert Park, passing through Pasir Panjang, and concluding at Shipyard Road close to the Mobil refinery. In the mid-1990s, the Jurong Railway was decommissioned due to changing logistics trends and the adoption of more efficient transportation methods. Shown above is a photograph of Jurong Railway taken in 1966.

| To capitalise on the newly established Jurong Industrial Estate and Jurong Port in the early 1960s, Jurong Shipyard was established in April 1963. This shipyard was tasked with the construction, maintenance, and repair of all types of ships and vessels. The establishment of Jurong Shipyard faced its share of challenges ranging from funding to obtaining the know-how. Despite these initial obstacles, the government, in collaboration with Japanese partners, set up the shipyard and went on to develop more at Keppel and Sembawang, thereby enhacing the country's shipbuilding and repair capabilities. Shown above is a 1966 photograph of Jurong Shipyard.

| The Jurong Fishery Port, established in 1969 at the former Tanjong Balai, to serve as a hub for the handling of fish imports into Singapore. This facility also functions as a marketing distribution center for seafood, featuring a wholesale fish market and various shops for the sale of seafood products. Besides handling fishing vessels from Indonesia and those operating in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Fishery Port also receives seafood via trucks from Malaysia and Thailand, as well as by air from countries including Australia, Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar, Taiwan and Vietnam.

| The development of Jurong as an industrial estate in Singapore included the construction of roads, with more than 30 thoroughfares built within the first decade of its development to connect factories to port facilities, housing estates, and the rest of the island. Interestingly, these new roads were given names that reflected themes of "industry" and "progress". For example, on the 1972 street map of Jurong, you could find roads with names like Corporation Road, Enterprise Road, Quality Road, Tractor Road, Fan Yoong Road (which means "Prosperity" Road in Chinese), Jalan Pesawat (or "Machinery" Road in Malay), or Neythal Road (or "Weaving" Road in Tamil, possibly referring to the presence of textile factories along the road). These names symbolised the industrial and economic growth taking place in Jurong.
