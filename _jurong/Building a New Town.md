In less than a decade after the launch of the Jurong Industrial Estate, Jurong grew into a bustling hub of factories and workers, and was the centerpiece of Singapore’s industrialisation efforts. The estate had attracted investments worth a total of about S$178 million in fixed assets and generated jobs for around 6,500 workers by the end of 1967. However, Dr Goh Keng Swee wanted Jurong to not only be an industrial estate, but also a town. This led to the birth of housing estates in Jurong and the building of recreation facilities, town centres, and flats.

### **Building Housing Estates in Jurong**

Taman Jurong is the first housing estate in Jurong. Originally called Neighbourhood I, it was built in 1963 to provide homes for the workers in the new industrial estate. The first flats in Taman Jurong were mostly one- and two-room units. However, not many people wanted them at first because there were not enough social amenities around. When this got better, more people wanted to live in Jurong Town. By the end of 1968, all 4,400 flats were taken, and about 16,000 people lived there. To meet the growing demand, the Jurong Town Corporation began to not only more flats, but "improved" types. These "improved" flats were bigger than standard flats at the time and had room layouts. They were also built in taller multi-storey buildings, thus changing the landscape of Jurong.

| During the 1970s, more housing estates such as Boon Lay Gardens, Teban Gardens, and Pandan Gardens were built in Jurong. Initially called Neighbourhood I, II, III, and IV, they were situated farther away from the heavy and medium industries along the coast near Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim road so that the residents were given a more pleasant environment to live in. In these newer neighbourhoods, the housing choices were mostly the bigger three-room and executive flats instead of the smaller one- and two-room flats. In fact, JTC stopped building one- and two-room flats when they started developing Boon Lay Gardens, Teban Gardens, and Pandan Gardens.

Beyond being a significant milestone and life achievement, the anticipation of a new home fosters an endearing and priceless experience. This sentiment is shared not only by present-day families but also by those from the nation-building years, including the pioneer residents of Jurong such as the former Chief Executive Officer of Jurong Town Council Teo Ho Pin.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">"Because Taman Jurong was a newly built industrial town. At that time not many flats were built by JTC, the Jurong Town Corporation. I think he was working in that area. He was quite familiar with Taman Jurong area, that's why he decided that maybe we should move to Taman Jurong.
<br>
<br>I would say that in those days Taman Jurong was basically a very small village. There are only a couple of blocks and not many residents around. So many of the residents would have known each other. And I would say that it is a very laidback, very simple way of life during that time.
<br>
<br>How many football fields... Based on that time when it was developed, I would have guessed it is maybe close to 50 football fields. It should be around there. Because the whole Taman Jurong was not fully developed. Now when I first moved in to Block 44 at Yung Seng Road, it was a three-storey building. Common corridor, common bin chute, and you can see the construction is very basic. It is a one-room flat, so we stayed in a one-room flat during that time.
<br>
<br>The living conditions were very simple. Basically you have a room; you have a small kitchen, one toilet. And a bedroom cum living room, cum everything. Multi-purpose room.”</span>

### **Building Amenities and Recreation Spaces**

The growth of Jurong Town was not an instant success as not many people wanted to live there initially. One reason was that it seemed far away from the rest of the island, making it less appealing. To enhance the appeal of Jurong as a residential area, initiatives were implemented starting in the late 1960s. These included the introduction of housing allowances, improved bus services, and the establishment of amenities and recreational spaces such as sports facilities, retail shops, community centers, wet markets, and hawker centers to public parks and gardens.

| The former Jurong Stadium was among the first recreational facilities to be built in Jurong. Completed in 1973, it was situated along Corporation Road in Taman Jurong. The stadium had a flat design and included a covered grandstand gallery overlooking a grass pitch encircled by an asphalt running track. Four tall iron truss structures, positioned at the corners, supported the floodlights. Until its demolition in 2020, the stadium provided sports and recreational facilities for local residents. Additionally, it served as a venue for the National Day Parade in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as various Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) ceremonies and parades, including Infantry Officers' commissioning parades and color presentation ceremonies for the Singapore Guards. Today, the residents of Jurong are served by stadiums such as Jurong East and Jurong West stadiums.

| Completed in 1978, Boon Lay Shopping Centre is one of the oldest shopping centres in Jurong. Located along Boon Lay Drive in Jurong West, the shopping centre has a shopping podium comprising 102 shops on the ground and first floors as well as a department store, a supermarket, coffeeshops, restaurant on the first and second floors at the time of its opening. After over 40 years of operations, the shopping centre was upgraded in 2012 with a new facade and better facilities such as escalators and elevators. Nonetheless, the shopping centre still retains its original architecture and nostalgia as it continues to serve the residents with a suite of mom-and-pop shops, money changers and shops for foreign workers, and travel agencies for trips to Malaysia.

| Boon Lay Community Centre is one of the oldest community centres in Jurong. Set up in 1979, it was initially located at a temporary site before shifting to its current premises at 10 Boon Lay Place in the early 1980s. Since then, the Community Centre has been serving the residents there offering them a place to socialise and learn through specialist clubs such as the Chinese Orchestra Group, Photographic Club and Chinese Chess Club. These clubs have been active in the Community Centre for well over 20 years, thus underlining the rich history of this Community Centre.

| In addition to Jurong Vocational Institute, there were also other schools being set up in Jurong Town during the 1960s and 1970s. These included Jurong Town Primary School (1968), Boon Lay Garden Primary School (1977), Yung An Primary School (1977), Merlimau Primary School (1977), Yung Ching Secondary School (1977) and Boon Lay Secondary School (1977).

| [Jurong Drive-in](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=bbfab240-c8be-4315-a0de-959b7dc0a0fe) is Singapore's first open-air cinema. Opened on 14 July 1971 by then Minister of Culture, Jek Yuen Thong, it was once located next to the Japanese Gardens. Conceived by Cathay Organisation, it was the largest drive-in cinema in Asia and could accommodate 900 cars as well as an additional 300 people in its walk-in gallery. The cinema offered a unique movie-watching experience for movie-goers, as they could watch English and Hong Kong films on a giant television screen from the privacy of the car. It was also one of the few places in Jurong and across the island where it was suitable for family outings. However, as the novelty wore off coupled with challenges such as unpredictable weather and the proliferation of air-conditioned cinemas in shopping malls as well as other attractions, Jurong Drive-in cinema was forced to close its doors in 1985 after 15 years of operation.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">"The drive-in cinema came about in the seventies..It was quite an excitement because that was the first drive-in cinema in Singapore. For us kids, we enjoyed because of the big screen it has a very big screen and…with all the speakers wired up, you actually can hear the movies from the side of the perimeter fencing. So although it has got fencing around the drive-in cinema, if you were to stay at a certain spot of the fencing, you actually can hear the movie. So you can watch the movie for free. That is the reason why I told you I watched this Bruce Lee show \[called\] “Fist of Fury” almost ten times. Because it is literally free…Every night there would be a movie, every night. So we would have a movie every night. Normally it is one show, 7.30pm to 9.30pm. Only one show. Sometimes there are two shows but most of the time it is one show. Weekends normally \[have\] two shows. Almost every night the movie is on…\[But\] when you drive to the drive-in cinema, first of all you have to switch off the car engine, you have to wind down the windows. So it becomes hot and humid. Then the mosquitoes ... so it becomes not so comfortable as compared to an air conditioned room, cinema. So I think at that time after the novelty or a couple of years the audienceship also dropped. As a result they couldn't survive. That was the reason why they closed the drive-in cinema…\[But\] it can be quite big \[during its heyday\]. When it was \[showing\] movies it was almost full house. When it is full house I think you can have easily a hundred over cars inside there. Quite a big drive-in cinema. At that time it was a novelty and you do see quite a lot of people from different parts of Singapore coming over to Jurong drive-in cinema. \[It shows\]...Chinese movies mainly…A lot of kungfu movies \[like\] “One Arm Swordsman” \[and\] different types of movies by Wang Yu (王羽).”</span>

| In 1974, the Jurong Ice Skating Centre was opened. Located along Yuan Ching Road in Taman Jurong, the S$9 million facility was the first ice skating rink in Singapore and Southeast Asia at the time. Charging skaters S$2.50 for a two-hour session on weekdays and the same price for an hour during weekends, its rink could accommodate up to 1,000 skaters. Initially, the skating centre was very popular but its novelty died down shortly resulting the centre to be closed merely four years later in 1978. Thereafter, Jurong would opened another ice skating centre in 1994 when Fuji Ice Palace Rink moved its operations to the Jurong Entertainment Centre (later renamed JCube) from the former Rex Theatre in&nbsp;McKenzie Road. Came equipped with an Olympic-sized rink, Fuji Ice Palace Rink was renamed The Rink@JCube in 2011. It was a popular venue for ice-skating, ice hockey and curling, attracting athletes and skaters of all levels before the rink was closed down in August 2023.

| Snow City is Singapore’s first permanent indoor snow centre. Opened in 2000, the centre is located beside the Singapore Science Centre and has a snow chamber that delivers snow experience all year round. The snow level is maintained at 400mm in depth and up to 150 tons of snow are required to cover the snow grounds. This means about 10 to 15 tons of snow is made each week to maintain this snow level. The centre is known for its three-storey high and 60-metres long snow slope where visitors could snow tube.

### **Building Parks and Gardens**

JTC also made sure that its housing estates were designed to have recreational areas and green spaces. During the planning phase, they set aside about 580 hectares of land, which is 12% of the total area, for parks, gardens, and other green areas. They also took into account the natural beauty of Jurong by creating a buffer zone in the upper Sungei Jurong area, separating the industrial and residential zones with trees, shrubs, and grassy fields. These initiatives not only added a touch of green to Jurong's industrial landscape but also preserved a part of the area's natural heritage.

| [Jurong Bird Park](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=e1852169-c5de-44ab-b794-c0635c8f0b89), which opened on 3 January 1971, was&nbsp;Asia's largest bird park and home to more than 5,000 birds across 400 species.&nbsp;Built at a cost of S$3.5 million, the 20.2-hectare &nbsp;park draws about 800,000 visitors annually. The park was the vision of then Minister for Finance, Goh Keng Swee, who was inspired by a visit to the Rio Aviary in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during a World Bank meeting in 1967. Recognising the value of a bird park as a recreational attraction during a period of rapid industrialisation and urbanisation in Jurong and the rest of Singapore, he proposed its creation in 1968. The park, designed by John Yealland and J. Toovey, was located on the western slope of&nbsp;Jurong Hil, and it attracted visitors from around the world when it opened its doors. Over the years, it introduced many exhibits&nbsp;including immersive walk-in aviaries such as Lory Loft, Jungle Jewels and Waterfall Aviary. In 2014, plans were announced to relocate the park to Mandai to be part of a larger precinct of nature-themed attractions called Mandai Wildlife Reserve. This led to the closure of Jurong Bird Park in January 2023 and its reopening as Bird Paradise on 8 May 2023.

The concept, dating back to 1968, included the creation of a green belt with landscaped gardens, a lake, and open spaces, with three islands designated for a Chinese garden, a Japanese garden, and a tropical garden. The design concept for the Chinese Garden was developed by Taiwanese expert Yu Yuen Chen, drawing inspiration from northern Chinese imperial architecture during the Song dynasty and the Summer Palace in Beijing. Notable features of the garden include marble stone lions, the 13-arch White Rainbow Bridge, an Arch and Main Gate complex, a Stone Boat and Tea House, and a seven-story pagoda. Over the years, the garden has seen additions, such as a Bonsai Garden and the Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum, and has become a popular location for Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, featuring large-scale festive displays.

| The Singapore Science Centre opened its doors to the public on 10 December 1977. Built at the cost of S$20 million, the it was set up to promote interest and learning in science and technology to students and the general public. This objective came at a time when Singapore was industrialising rapidly and going up the technology ladder was all-important.&nbsp;The Centre was located off Jurong Town Hall Road near the eastern bank of Jurong Lake. Over the next decades, the Singapore Science Centre underwent several expansions. One major expansion was the opening of Omni-Theatre in 1987.

At the time of its opening in 1970, the park featured a three-story observatory tower that provided its visitors including foreign guests and investors invited by the government a panoramic view of the nearby Jurong Industrial Estate. The tower also housed a restaurant, which, unfortunately, closed down in 1976 due to poor business. Besides the observatory tower, there was also a landscaped garden with footpaths, benches, refreshment kiosks, public restrooms, and a "Garden of Fame". The latter where foreign dignitaries like Queen Elizabeth II, Deng Xiaoping, and Dr. Albert Winsemius had planted trees there between 1969 and 1984. In total, 30 trees were planted before the Garden was relocated to the compound of Jurong Town Hall.

There were quite a lot of excitement because these two were specially designed gardens, for Taman Jurong. So in a way it does bring a different set of architecture and landscape to the town. The Japanese Garden has got a lot of Japanese bonsai, rock garden. So it is very Japanese. Whereas the Chinese garden has a lot of Chinese architecture, it has got pagoda, it has got bridges. So again it is a different set of design. So these two sets of design are very new to the residents in Taman Jurong. The residents in Taman Jurong were mainly from the industrial estate so they were mainly from the working population. So to see these two sets of architecture is a...different experience altogether. And they do have a number of events. I remember they have Lantern Festival, they have events at the Chinese Garden So they have some festivals and some events at that time at these two gardens. And that did bring quite a lot of visitors and residents to the two gardens. And of course the Chinese Garden and Japanese Garden were very popular with taking of wedding photos.

In the '70s and '80s the main social centre is the CC (Community Centre). The CC provided the most important social interaction focal point. Then we have a number of common places - the parks. So we have the Japanese Garden, Chinese Garden and Jurong Park. So there are three parks in Taman Jurong. And of course, swimming complex, swimming pool. And the rest are common grassland parcels between the blocks, where you can see a lot of children playing. We didn't have void decks at that point. We only have those so called grassland or land parcels between blocks where we can play football, or play marbles or spin tops. You'd find that a lot of activities are all very visible within the built environment. That means during kite flying you can see all the kites are flying between the blocks. So sometimes it get trapped in television antennae, sometimes it get trapped on the road lamp-post or trees. So you can see that during the kite season a lot of kites will be trapped by all these installations within the housing estate. So that is the interesting part of it. Then you can see people, there will be one kite ... because there will be kite- fighting, so we will go and collect glass. We will pound glass and then we go and put the glass, glue on the kite string so that we will fight.

| Besides having housing estates, recreational spaces and social amenities. The residents of Jurong Town were also treated with a suite of hawker centres. The first hawker centre that was built there was Yung Sheng Food Centre. Located at 3 Yung Sheng Road, it was also Singapore's first hawker centre and was sometimes referred to as “60 stalls” (or "liu shi tan" in Mandarin) after the 60 stalls that opened together with the hawker centre in July 1972.

| There were also other hawker centres in Jurong Town during the 1970s. These included Jurong Market I, Taman Jurong I Food Centre, Jurong II Market and Taman Jurong II Food Centre. In 1979 through a renaming exercise by the then Ministry of Environment, Jurong Market I, Taman Jurong I Food Centre, Jurong II Market and Taman Jurong II Food Centre were renamed Corporation Drive Market, Corporation Drive Food Centre, Taman Jurong Market and Taman Jurong Food Centre respectively.

| Today, Taman Jurong Market and Food Centre along Yung Sheng Road is the amalgamation of three hawker centres - Corporation Drive Market, Corporate Drive Food Centre and Yung Sheng Food Centre. Opened in 2005, the new food centre houses many hawkers from the original centres. It was also designed with patrons in mind, as the ventilation systems in place permits good air circulation, and there is a variety of seats catered to big and small families alike. In the food centre, there is also a central courtyard so that natural sunlight could stream into the dining area. Together with increased ventilation, the layout of the food centre also allows for better interaction between patrons, and for families to gather and enjoy a meal.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">"The night market mainly you have the street performers, then you have people selling different things. Mainly *tieda* \[铁打\] medicated oil…not so much food. Because the hawker centres already have a wide range of food. So you don't have many food stalls outside. Occasionally you will find people selling chestnuts. Sometimes they sell peanuts. But the majority are mainly street performers \[doing\] *tieda*…they tell you if you get injured, this is where you can buy this sort of medicated oil to massage your muscles and so on. There were many of these and some of course they have religious items they sell…\[and these\] vendors were not licensed.”</span>
