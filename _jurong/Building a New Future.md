From the 1990s, the Jurong region began the journey to become the future precinct of Singapore when plans to create a regional centre, a business district and an innovation district there were announced in 1991, 2008 and 2016 respectively. This led to the launch of numerous development which saw the establishment of a business park, a shopping enclave, an innovation hub, and a flurry of public and private residential projects.

### **Building a Regional Centre**

The vision to create a regional centre in Jurong was unveiled as part of the 1991 Concept Plan. Centering around Jurong East MRT station, this vision was to turn the area into a gateway for the entire Western region through the offer of a mix of commercial and social amenities and residential facilities.

Concept Plans (known today as Long-Term Plan Review) are strategic land-use and transportation plans that guided the physical transformation of Singapore during the nation-building years. The first Concept Plan was unveiled in 1971 and it advocated for the development of a ring structure of satellite towns around the Central Water Catchment, supported by the Central Area as the Central Business District (CBD). In the 1991 Concept Plan, a decentralised policy was introduced whereby four regional centres, supported by sub-regional and fringe centres, were identified to bring jobs closer to homes to alleviate congestion in the city centre. This approach turned fringe locations such as at Tampines, Buona Vista and Newton into regional hubs where residents could work, live, play and learn.

Jurong East, along with Woodlands, Tampines and the Seletar area were identified as the four regional centres in the 1991 Concept Plan. Besides proposing for developments around these regional centres to support activities for work, play, culture and commerce. It also called for nature, waterbodies and recreational spaces to be woven seamlessly together with the centres. In Jurong, the regional centre was to be built around Jurong East MRT station. Completed in 1988, the MRT station is an interchange between the East-West Line and the North-South Line. Although construction of public housing in Jurong East had started as early as the 1970s, much of the land surrounding the MRT station was left vacant in anticipation of future development. In the 1995 Jurong East planning area report earmarked nine hectares on either side of the station for high-rise commercial tower blocks, with medium-rise office blocks sited farther away.

The urban design approach to create a distinctive skyline for the Jurong Regional Centre to signify it as a gateway to the Western region is the massing of building around Jurong East MRT station at close proximity. At the time of the planning, it was envisioned that the MRT station would be surrounded by 4 tower blocks of up to 35 storeys at its core, and an outer core comprising a mix of office, retail and institutional buildings of up to 12 storeys at the periphery. Access to the regional centre would be served by the existing MRT line, a new bus interchange, a one-way inner ring road system for vehicular traffic, and an integrated pedestrian precinct comprising open and covered walkways and skylinks for pedestrians.

To kickstart the Regional Centre, the public sector embarked on a number of developments. For instance, the Jurong Town Council (JTC) established the 37-hectare International Business Park, which was Singapore’s first business park, there in 1992. This was followed by the JTC Summit which became the headquarters of JTC after it moved into the building in 2000 from Jurong Town Hall. 

These public sector projects were then followed by commercial and retail developments. Two distincitve projects that took root in Jurong East during the 1990s include Jurong Entertainment Centre and International Merchandising Mart (IMM) Mall. Opened in September 1993, Jurong Entertainment Centre had a retail floor area of 110,000 square feet, featuring a cineplex operated by Shaw Theatres, an amusement arcade, a bowling alley, retail shops and eateries, and a ice rink known as Fuji Ice Palace on third floor.

International Merchandising Mart Mall (usually referred to as IMM Mall) is an a five-storey mall with over 960,000 square feet of retail space. Opened in 1991, it also offers  warehousing facilities. The mall has capacity for 235 retail outlets and 430 non-retail outlets. In May 2012, IMM underwent a $30 million renovation project which saw the mall's facilities being improved and retail space increased.

### **Building a Business District**

In 2008, the Jurong Regional Centre vision was expanded and rebranded as the Jurong Lake District. Centering around Jurong Lake and covering an area as large as the new downtown at Marina Bay, the new lake district is designed to be Singapore's second Central Business District (CBD) with the aim of bringing more offices, retail, homes and leisure to the area.

First unveiled in the 2008 Master Plan and later updated in 2017, Jurong Lake District  is envisioned as a lively and vibrant mixed-use business district, with its own live-in population and an attractive street life for both locals and visitors. The district spans over 400 hectares and it comprises the existing commercial node around Jurong East MRT Station (or the Jurong Regional Centre); a complementary leisure and recreational precinct surrounding Jurong Lake Gardens; an upcoming mixed-use estate around the future Cross-Island Line Station; and the International Business Park, which has been rejuvenated to include more mixed uses.

As part of the development of Jurong Lake District , the Jurong Regional Centre was renamed Jurong Gateway. While it remains a commercial hub, its function was expanded so that it can be positioned as a place for company headquarters, business services as well as companies in the science and the research and development fields. In addition, Jurong Gateway is also designated for development into an integrated commercial and transport hub with spaces set aside for office, residential and hotel use, as well as retail, F&B and entertainment. All in all, Jurong Gateway is to be a business district that is away from the city centre so that jobs can be brought closer to homes.

To provide recreational opportunities within the Jurong Lake District, a new national garden was created around Jurong Lake. Known as Jurong Lake Gardens, the 90-hectare Gardens will be Singapore's third national garden after the Singapore Botanic Gardens and Gardens by the Bay. It comprises a redeveloped Chinese and Japanese Gardens at the central part of Jurong Lake, the expansive 60-hectare Lakeside Garden in the west, a Garden Promenade in the east, and a new Science Centre in the north. Neighbourhoods are planned around the lake making it easy and convenient for people to walk, cycle and take public transport to amenities and attractions located close by.

By 2040 to 2050, Jurong Lake District is slated to provide 100,000 new jobs and 20,000 new homes. It is currently taking shape rapidly with the completion of a series of projects among others. These include retail spaces such as Jem and Westgate in Jurong Gateway in 2013, the opening of Jurong Lake Gardens in 2019, as well as the completion of a number of pedestrian walkways including the 270-metre pedestrian mall J-Link and the elevated pedestrian network J-Walk. In the coming years, more projects within the lake district will be added to the lake district. These include the new Science Centre, the revamped Chinese and Japanese Gardens, the Jurong Regional Line, the Jurong East integrated transportation hub, and many public and private residential projects.


### **Building an Innovation Hub**

The country’s manufacturing sector currently employs about 450,000 people and makes up about 21 per cent of its gross domestic product. Singapore aims to grow the sector by 50 per cent by 2030, and with advanced manufacturing instead of more traditional, labour-intensive manufacturing, it can free up workers for higher-value work, according to the Manufacturing 2030 plan released last year.

Jurong Innovation District

Opening in phases from 2024, JID brings together a growing ecosystem of research institutions, capability developers, training and technology firms and manufacturers to bolster Singapore’s ambitions in advanced manufacturing.
