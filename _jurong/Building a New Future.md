Since the 1990s, the Jurong region has undergone a transformation, evolving into a precinct of the future for Singapore. This evolution was set in motion by the announcements of plans to create a regional centre in 1991, a business district in 2008, and an innovation district in 2016. Subsequently, a series of developments unfolded, giving rise to a business park, a shopping enclave, an innovation hub, and a plethora of public and private residential projects as well as recreational spaces.

### **Building a New Regional Centre**

The vision to establish a regional centre in Jurong was introduced as part of the 1991 Concept Plan. Centering around Jurong East MRT station, this vision aimed to transform the area into a gateway for the entire Western region by providing a blend of commercial, social, and residential amenities.

| Concept Plans, now known as Long-Term Plan Reviews, played a crucial role in guiding Singapore's physical transformation during its early years of nation-building. The inaugural Concept Plan was introduced in 1971, outlining the development of satellite towns arranged in a ring structure around the Central Water Catchment, with the Central Area serving as the Central Business District (CBD). The 1991 Concept Plan introduced a decentralized policy, identifying four regional centers supported by sub-regional and fringe centers. This approach aimed to bring jobs closer to residential areas, easing congestion in the city center. Fringe locations like Tampines, Buona Vista, and Newton were transformed into regional hubs, promoting a holistic environment for residents to work, live, play, and learn.

| In the 1991 Concept Plan, Jurong East, along with Woodlands, Tampines, and the Seletar area, was designated as one of the four regional centers. The plan aimed to integrate developments around these regional centers to support work, leisure, culture, and commerce. It emphasised the seamless integration of nature, water bodies, and recreational spaces with the urban centers. Jurong's regional center was envisioned to revolve around Jurong East MRT station, which became operational in 1988 as an interchange between the East-West Line and the North-South Line. While public housing construction in Jurong East began in the 1970s, substantial land around the MRT station remained undeveloped, awaiting future development. The 1995 Jurong East planning area report specifically allocated nine hectares on either side of the station for high-rise commercial tower blocks, complemented by medium-rise office blocks situated farther away.

| The design approach to create a distinctive skyline for the Jurong Regional Centre to signify it as a gateway to the Western region is the massing of building around Jurong East MRT station at close proximity. At the time of the planning, it was envisioned that the MRT station would be surrounded by 4 tower blocks of up to 35 storeys at its core, and an outer core comprising a mix of office, retail and institutional buildings of up to 12 storeys at the periphery. Access to the regional centre would be served by the existing MRT line, a new bus interchange, a one-way inner ring road system for vehicular traffic, and an integrated pedestrian precinct comprising open and covered walkways and skylinks for pedestrians.

| To initiate the development of the Jurong Regional Centre, the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) established a 37-hectare International Business Park near Jurong East MRT station. Designed as a hub for corporations to establish their regional headquarters, innovation centers and other operations, the business park is now host to several high-tech companies, including Acer, JGC Singapore, Creative Technology, ThyssenKrupp, Evonik, and Johnson Control. In addition to the business park, JTC also constructed a new headquarters within the Jurong Regional Centre. Known as JTC Summit, JTC has been operating from the 31-storey building since relocating there from Jurong Town Hall in 2000.

| In the 1990s, following public sector initiatives, commercial and retail projects began to flourish in Jurong East. Notably, two projects emerged during this period: the Jurong Entertainment Centre and the International Merchandising Mart (IMM) Mall. The Jurong Entertainment Centre, which was completed in 1993 and later demolished and replaced by JCube in 2012, boasted a retail floor area of 110,000 square feet, housing a cineplex operated by Shaw Theatres, an amusement arcade, a bowling alley, retail shops and eateries, and an ice rink named Fuji Ice Palace on the third floor. On the other hand, the International Merchandising Mart Mall, commonly known as IMM Mall, is a five-storey facility encompassing over 960,000 square feet of retail space. It opened in 1991, offering warehousing facilities and accommodating 235 retail outlets and 430 non-retail outlets. In May 2012, IMM underwent a $30 million renovation project, enhancing its facilities and expanding retail space.

### **Building a New Business District**

In 2008, the Urban Redevelopment Authority revealed plans as part of the Master Plan to create the Jurong Lake District in Jurong. Encompassing Jurong Lake and spanning an area comparable to the new downtown at Marina Bay, this ambitious project aims to develop Singapore's second Central Business District (CBD). The vision is to introduce a mix of offices, retail spaces, residences, and recreational amenities to transform the area into a vibrant and dynamic district.

| Unveiled in the 2008 Master Plan and subsequently updated in 2017, the Jurong Lake District is envisioned as a dynamic and diverse mixed-use business district. Spanning over 400 hectares, the district includes the regional cetnre around Jurong East MRT Station, a complementary leisure and recreational precinct surrounding Jurong Lake Gardens, an upcoming mixed-use estate around the future Cross-Island Line Station, and the rejuvenated International Business Park, incorporating a broader range of mixed uses. The goal is to create a vibrant district with a resident population, offering an appealing street life for both locals and visitors.

| As part of the development of Jurong Lake District , the Jurong Regional Centre was renamed Jurong Gateway. While it remains a commercial hub, its function was expanded so that it can be positioned as a place for company headquarters, business services as well as companies in the science and the research and development fields. In addition, Jurong Gateway is also designated for development into an integrated commercial and transport hub with spaces set aside for office, residential and hotel use, as well as retail, F&amp;B and entertainment. All in all, Jurong Gateway is to be a business district that is away from the city centre so that jobs can be brought closer to homes.

| To enhance recreational opportunities within the Jurong Lake District, a new national garden, Jurong Lake Gardens, was established around Jurong Lake. Spanning 90 hectares, it is Singapore's third national garden, following the Singapore Botanic Gardens and Gardens by the Bay. The Gardens include the revamped Chinese and Japanese Gardens at the heart of Jurong Lake, the expansive 60-hectare Lakeside Garden in the west, a Garden Promenade in the east, and a new Science Centre in the north. The surrounding neighborhoods are designed to facilitate easy access for residents to amenities and attractions via walking, cycling, and public transport.

| Between 2040 and 2050, the Jurong Lake District aims to generate 100,000 new jobs and create 20,000 new homes. The district has been rapidly evolving, marked by the completion of several significant projects. Notable developments include retail spaces like Jem and Westgate in Jurong Gateway (2013), the inauguration of Jurong Lake Gardens in 2019, and the establishment of key pedestrian walkways such as the 270-meter J-Link pedestrian mall and the elevated pedestrian network J-Walk. Upcoming projects in the district encompass the new Science Centre, the rejuvenated Chinese and Japanese Gardens, the Jurong Regional Line, the integrated transportation hub in Jurong East, and various public and private residential initiatives.

### **Building a New Innovation Hub**

In 2016, the government unveiled plans in its Budget statement to establish an innovation hub in Jurong. Known as the Jurong Innovation District, this move marked a pivotal moment in the economic evolution of both Jurong and Singapore. The district is envisioned as a catalyst for new economic activities, fostering innovation, research and development (R&amp;D), and advanced technologies. With a focus on cultivating a highly skilled workforce, the Jurong Innovation District represents a strategic initiative aimed at propelling Singapore's economic transformation forward.

The unveiling of the Jurong Innovation District coincided with Singapore's strategic efforts to elevate its manufacturing sector up the value-added chain. Currently employing approximately 450,000 individuals and contributing around 21 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP), the manufacturing sector plays a pivotal role in Singapore's economic landscape. The Manufacturing 2030 plan aims to propel the sector's growth by 50 percent by 2030, prioritizing advanced manufacturing over traditional, labor-intensive methods. This transformative approach seeks to not only reallocate workers to higher-value tasks but also position Singapore's manufacturing as an innovation-driven industry, emphasizing research and development (R&amp;D), cutting-edge technologies like robotics and AI, and a highly skilled workforce.

The Jurong Innovation District is designed to cultivate an ideal environment or ecosystem for the transformation of Singapore's manufacturing sector. Encompassing a vast 620-hectare district, it integrates educational institutions such as Nanyang Technological University and A*/STAR Advanced Manufacturing Training Academy, research and development (R&amp;D) institutions like Surbana Jurong Campus and A*/STAR Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre, and high-tech companies including Siemens Advanced Manufacturing Transformation Center, Konica Minolta, and Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Centre. The district also features mixed-use spaces, allowing companies not only to establish advanced manufacturing facilities but also to leverage talent, research, and cutting-edge technologies like robotics and other Industry 4.0 solutions to enhance their business operations.

JTC has conceptualised the Jurong Innovation District not merely as a conventional industrial estate, but also a multifaceted zone that seamlessly blends work and recreation. This visionary district will feature amenities, revitalized parks, and public spaces, catering to both the working populace within the district and residents from the neighboring areas. With green coverage amounting to 40 percent of the district, including green links, parks like the Jurong Eco-Garden and Bulim Park, and dedicated pathways teeming with native birds and butterflies, Jurong Innovation District is set to be a harmonious convergence of technology, talent, and sustainability. It aims to serve as a hub where these elements coalesce to inspire innovative ideas that redefine the world we inhabit. Opening in phases from 2024, the district is expected to evolve into a thriving ecosystem encompassing research institutions, capability developers, training and technology firms, and manufacturers, all contributing to Singapore's aspirations in advanced manufacturing.
