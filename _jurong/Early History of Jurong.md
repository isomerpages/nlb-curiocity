Jurong is an area in the southwest of Singapore. Comprising of housing estates such as Jurong West and Jurong East as well as the innovation, business and industrial estates of Jurong Lake District and the Jurong Innovation District among others, it was a very different place before its development in the 1960s. Largely undeveloped, it was an area of swamps, jungles and plantations with numerous river, steams and tributaries.

Captain James Franklin and Lieutenant Philip Jackson's 1828 map of Singapore (shown above), which is one of the earliest maps that properly captured the outline of Singapore Island, details a number of natural features associated with Jurong including the Jurong and Pandan rivers, as well as the former islands that made up Jurong Island today such as Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Seraya and Pulau Sakra. In the Tuas area, Tanjong (or promontory) Rawa and Tanjong Gull (Tanjong Gul) were also indicated in the map.

These natural features of Jurong including Jurong and Pandan rivers were also indicated in this 1855 hydrographic survey of the Straits of Singapore (shown above). Drawn by Captain Samuel Congalton and Government Surveyor John Turnbull Thomson, this map is one of the first detailed hydrographic surveys of the Straits to be conducted by a locally based surveyor.

While early 19th century maps of Singapore captured the natural features of Jurong , those that were produced in the later half as well as the early 20th century indicated that the boundary of Jurong is only a fraction of the locale we know today. For instance, in this 1885 map of the island of Singapore, Jurong is bounded by Pandan in the south, West Bukit Timah in the north, Upper Tanglin in the east, and Peng Kang in the west.

In this 1924 map of which shows the mukim numbers of different districts of Singapore, Jurong's mukim number is indicated as "X" or "10". Since the 1902, every land parcel in Singapore is uniquely identified by a lot number. This identifier has two components, namely the survey districts Mukim (or Town Subdivision) number and the lot number. For administrative purposes, Singapore is divided into 34 Mukims and 30 Town Subdivisions.

### **Peng Kang and Plantations**

In the 19th century, much of the forests in Jurong were cleared to make way for gambier plantations. The cash crop was so popular that a district in Jurong was named "Peng Kang", which may be derived from a Malay term for boiling gambier leaves. In general, Peng Kang covers the areas we know today as Jurong West and Boon Lay.
