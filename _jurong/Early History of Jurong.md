Jurong is a large area in the southwest of Singapore that is known today as an industrial estate and a residential town. However, before its development in the 1960s, Jurong had a very different landscape and history as it was once a swampy land covered with mangroves, plantations, villages, and brickworks. It even had a different name as it was referred to as "Peng Kang". Interestingly, traces of the name 'Jurong' can be found in early colonial maps of Singapore, often associated with natural features like the "Jurong River".

### **Early Accounts of Jurong**

Although Jurong is demarcated as a large area today, it was vastly different back then.



Captain James Franklin and Lieutenant Philip Jackson's 1828 map of Singapore (shown above), which was the first map which properly captured the outline of Singapore Island, details a number of natural features associated with Jurong including the Jurong and Pandan rivers, as well as the former islands that made up Jurong Island today such as Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Seraya and Pulau Sakra. In the Tuas area, Tanjong (or promontory) Rawa and TanjongÂ Gull (Tanjong Gul) were also indicated.
