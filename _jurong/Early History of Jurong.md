Jurong is a large area in the southwest of Singapore that is known today as an industrial estate and a residential town. However, before its development in the 1960s, Jurong had a very different landscape and history as it was once a swampy land covered with mangroves, plantations, villages, and brickworks. It even had a different name as it was referred to as "Peng Kang". Interestingly, traces of the name 'Jurong' can be found in early colonial maps of Singapore, often associated with natural features like the "Jurong River".

### **Early Accounts of Jurong**

Although Jurong is demarcated as a large area today, it was vastly different back then.

Captain James Franklin and Lieutenant Philip Jackson's 1828 map of Singapore (shown above), which is one of the earliest maps that properly captured the outline of Singapore Island, details a number of natural features associated with Jurong including the Jurong and Pandan rivers, as well as the former islands that made up Jurong Island today such as Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Seraya and Pulau Sakra. In the Tuas area, Tanjong (or promontory) Rawa and TanjongÂ Gull (Tanjong Gul) were also indicated in the map.

These natural features of Jurong including Jurong and Pandan rivers were also indicated in this 1855 hydrographic survey of the Straits of Singapore (shown above). Drawn by Captain Samuel Congalton and Government Surveyor John Turnbull Thomson, this map is one of the first detailed hydrographic surveys of the Straits to be conducted by a locally based surveyor.

While many 19th century maps of Singapore captured the natural features of Jurong , those that were produced in the 20th century were able to provide an indication on the extent where the boundary of Jurong stretches back then. For instance, this 1911 map (shown above) reveals that Jurong is only a fraction of the locale we know today as it is bounded by Jurong Road in the south, Choa Chu Kang in the north and west, and Bukit Timah Road in the east.
