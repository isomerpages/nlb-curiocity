Jurong is a large area in the southwest of Singapore that is known today as an industrial estate and a residential town. However, before its development in the 1960s, Jurong had a very different landscape and history as it was once a swampy land covered with mangroves, plantations, villages, and brickworks. It even had a different name as it was referred to as "Peng Kang". Interestingly, traces of the name 'Jurong' can be found in early colonial maps of Singapore, often associated with natural features like the "Jurong River".
