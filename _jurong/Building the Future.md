From the 1990s, the Jurong region began the journey to become the future precinct of Singapore when plans to create a regional centre, a business district and an innovation district there were announced in 1991, 2008 and 2016 respectively. This led to the launch of numerous development which saw the establishment of a business park, a shopping enclave, an innovation hub, and a flurry of public and private residential projects.

### **Building a Regional Centre**

The vision to create a regional centre in Jurong was unveiled as part of the 1991 Concept Plan. Centering around Jurong East MRT station, this vision was to turn the area into a gateway for the entire Western region through the offer of a mix of commercial and social amenities and residential facilities.



Completed in 1988, the Jurong East station is an interchange between the EWL and the NSL when the latter’s Woodlands extension opened in 1996. Although construction of public housing in Jurong East had started as early as the 1970s, much of the land surrounding the MRT station was left vacant in anticipation of future development. In the 1995 Jurong East planning area report earmarked nine hectares (90,000 m2) on either side of the station for high-rise commercial tower blocks, with medium-rise office blocks sited farther away.

To kickstart the Regional Centre, the public sector embarked on a number of developments. For instance, the Jurong Town Council (JTC) established the 37-hectare International Business Park, which was Singapore’s first business park, there in 1992. This was followed by the JTC Summit which became the headquarters of JTC after it moved into the building in 2000 from Jurong Town Hall.

Jurong Regional Centre became Jurong Lake District (JLD) in 2008, with a new plan to help shed its industrial image and bring more offices, retail, homes and leisure to the area.
