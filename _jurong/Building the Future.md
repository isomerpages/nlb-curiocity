From the 1990s, the Jurong region began the journey to become the future precinct of Singapore when plans to create a regional centre, a business district and an innovation district there were announced in 1991, 2008 and 2016 respectively. This led to the launch of numerous development which saw the establishment of a business park, a shopping enclave, an innovation hub, and a flurry of public and private residential projects.

### **Building a Regional Centre**

The vision to create a regional centre in Jurong was unveiled as part of the 1991 Concept Plan. Centering around Jurong East MRT station, this vision was to turn the area into a gateway for the entire Western region through the offer of a mix of commercial and social amenities and residential facilities.

Concept Plans (known today as Long-Term Plan Review) are strategic land-use and transportation plans that guided the physical transformation of Singapore during the nation-building years. The first Concept Plan was unveiled in 1971 and it advocated for the development of a ring structure of satellite towns around the Central Water Catchment, supported by the Central Area as the Central Business District (CBD). In the 1991 Concept Plan, a decentralised policy was introduced whereby four regional centres, supported by sub-regional and fringe centres, were identified to bring jobs closer to homes to alleviate congestion in the city centre. This approach turned fringe locations such as at Tampines, Buona Vista and Newton into regional hubs where residents could work, live, play and learn.

Jurong East, along with Woodlands, Tampines and the Seletar area were identified as the four regional centres in the 1991 Concept Plan. Besides proposing for developments around these regional centres to support activities for work, play, culture and commerce. It also called for nature, waterbodies and recreational spaces to be woven seamlessly together with the centres. In Jurong, the regional centre was to be built around Jurong East MRT station. Completed in 1988, the MRT station is an interchange between the East-West Line and the North-South Line. Although construction of public housing in Jurong East had started as early as the 1970s, much of the land surrounding the MRT station was left vacant in anticipation of future development. In the 1995 Jurong East planning area report earmarked nine hectares (90,000 m2) on either side of the station for high-rise commercial tower blocks, with medium-rise office blocks sited farther away.

The urban design approach to create a distinctive skyline for the Jurong Regional Centre to signify it as a gateway to the Western region is the massing of building. 

To kickstart the Regional Centre, the public sector embarked on a number of developments. For instance, the Jurong Town Council (JTC) established the 37-hectare International Business Park, which was Singaporeâ€™s first business park, there in 1992. This was followed by the JTC Summit which became the headquarters of JTC after it moved into the building in 2000 from Jurong Town Hall. 

These public sector projects were then followed by commercial and retail developments. Two distincitve projects that took root in Jurong East during the 1990s include the Jurong Entertainment Centre and the International Merchandising Mart (IMM) Mall.
