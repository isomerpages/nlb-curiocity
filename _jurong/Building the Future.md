From the 1990s, the Jurong region began the journey to become the future precinct of Singapore when plans to turn the area into a regional centre and later a business district were announced in 1991 and 2008 respectively. This led to the launch of numerous development which saw the establishment of a business park, a shopping enclave, and a flurry of public and private residential projects.

### **Building a New Regional Centre in Jurong**

The vision to create a regional centre in Jurong was unveiled as part of the 1991 Concept Plan. Centering around the Jurong East MRT station, this vision was to turn Jurong into a gateway for the entire Western region through the offer of a mix of commercial and social amenities and residential facilities.

International Business Park (Singapore's first business park for knowledge-based activities) and JTC Summit (headquarters for JTC Corporation) were among the first developments. Five decades on, the former swamp is now a manufacturing hub for many high-value industries and an attractive residential town.
