Jurong is a large area in the southwest of Singapore that is known today as an industrial estate and a residential town. However, before its development in the 1960s, Jurong had a very different landscape and history. Jurong was once a swampy land covered with mangroves, plantations, villages, and brickworks. It also witnessed some significant events during the Japanese Occupation and the early years of Singaporeâ€™s self-government.
