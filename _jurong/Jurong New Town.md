In less than a decade after the launch of the Jurong Industrial Estate, Jurong grew into a bustling hub of factories and workers, and was the centerpiece of Singapore’s industrialisation efforts. The estate had attracted investments worth a total of about S$178 million in fixed assets and generated jobs for around 6,500 workers. However, Dr Goh Keng Swee wanted Jurong to not only be an industrial estate, but also a town. This led to the birth of housing estates in Jurong and the building of recreational facilities, town centres, and flats.

### **Developing Housing Estates in Jurong**

Even though Jurong industrial estate grew quickly and provided many jobs, not many people wanted to live there. One reason for this was that it seemed far away from the rest of the island, making it less appealing. To make Jurong a better place to live, starting in the late 1960s, efforts were made to improve it. They added more housing choices, built shops, social places, places to have fun, and made transportation better.

| The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) led the effort to make Jurong a more appealing place for people looking for homes. They started by building the first housing estates like Taman Jurong in 1968, followed by Boon Lay Gardens, Teban Gardens, and Pandan Gardens in the 1970s. These estates were initially called Neighbourhood I, II, III, and IV. They were situated farther away from the heavy and medium industries along the coast near Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim road. JTC also offered bigger housing choices for new home seekers in these estates by constructing more three-room and executive flats instead of the smaller one- and two-room flats. In fact, JTC stopped building one- and two-room flats when they started developing Boon Lay Gardens, Teban Gardens, and Pandan Gardens.

| Besides having bigger housing units, the housing estates in Jurong was also supplemented with shops and amenities including markets and hawker centres. The first hawker centre that was built in Jurong was Yung Sheng Food Centre. Located at 3 Yung Sheng Road, it was also called “60 stalls” (or "liu shi tan" in Mandarin) after the 60 stalls that opened together with the hawker centre in July 1972. Besides Yung Sheng Food Centre, Jurong Market I and Jurong Market II were also among the first hawker centres that came into operations during the 1970s. Located along Corporation Drive, Jurong Market I was renamed Corporation Drive Market in 1979 to serve the residents staying in the vicinity of Hu Ching and Yung Loh roads in Jurong West. As for Jurong Market II, it was located near Yung Sheng Food Centre and was redeveloped together with Yung Sheng Food Centre as today's Taman Jurong Market and Food Centre along Yung Sheng Road. Despite the redevelopment, the legacy of the two hawker centres were retained as the new Taman Jurong Market and Food Centre houses many original hawkers from the original Yung Sheng Food Centre and Jurong Market I.

| The former Jurong Stadium was among the first recreational facilities to be built in Jurong. Completed in 1973, it was situated along Corporation Road in Taman Jurong. The stadium had a flat design and included a covered grandstand gallery overlooking a grass pitch encircled by an asphalt running track. Four tall iron truss structures, positioned at the corners, supported the floodlights. Until its demolition in 2020, the stadium provided sports and recreational facilities for local residents. Additionally, it served as a venue for the National Day Parade in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as various Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) ceremonies and parades, including Infantry Officers' commissioning parades and color presentation ceremonies for the Singapore Guards. Today, the residents of Jurong are served by stadiums such as Jurong East and Jurong West stadiums.

| Completed in 1978, Boon Lay Shopping Centre is one of the oldest shopping centres in Jurong. Located along Boon Lay Drive in Jurong West, the shopping centre has a shopping podium comprising 102 shops on the ground and first floors as well as a department store, a supermarket, coffeeshops, restaurant on the first and second floors at the time of its opening. After over 40 years of operations, the shopping centre was upgraded in 2012 with a new facade and better facilities such as escalators and elevators. Nonetheless, the shopping centre still retains its original architecture and nostalgia as it continues to serve the residents with a suite of mom-and-pop shops, money changers and shops for foreign workers, and travel agencies for trips to Malaysia.

| Boon Lay Community Centre is one of the oldest community centres in Jurong. Set up in 1979, it was initially located at a temporary site before shifting to its current premises at 10 Boon Lay Place in the early 1980s. Since then, the Community Centre has been serving the residents there offering them a place to socialise and learn through specialist clubs such as the Chinese Orchestra Group, Photographic Club and Chinese Chess Club. These clubs have been active in the Community Centre for well over 20 years, thus underlining the rich history of this Community Centre.

| The Jurong Vocational Institute was one of the first schools being built in Jurong following its industrailisation. Located along Jalan Boon Lay, it was completed in 1969. In 2000, the school was relocated to Bukit Batok and was renamed renamed ITE ([Institute of Technical Education](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1835_2011-08-31.html)) Jurong. Besides ITE Jurong, Boon Lay Garden Primary School and Boon Lay Secondary School were also among the oldest schools in Jurong. Completed in the 1970s, the schools received their first batch of students in 1977. Under an urban renewal programme for Jurong and Boon Lay launched in the 1990s, Boon Lay Secondary School moved from 247 Jalan Boon Lay to a new campus in Jurong West in 1999, while Boon Lay Garden Primary School shifted from Boon Lay Avenue to new premises at 20 Boon Lay Drive in 2001. In 2010, River Valley High School moved to its current campus in Boon Lay. The 7.6-hectare campus is one of the largest among government schools in Singapore and includes a 500-bed hostel for both local and international students.

| [Jurong Drive-in](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=bbfab240-c8be-4315-a0de-959b7dc0a0fe) is Singapore's first open-air cinema. Opened on 14 July 1971 by then Minister of Culture, Jek Yuen Thong, it was once located next to the Japanese Gardens. Conceived by Cathay Organisation, it was the largest drive-in cinema in Asia and could accommodate 900 cars as well as an additional 300 people in its walk-in gallery. The cinema offered a unique movie-watching experience for movie-goers, as they could watch English and Hong Kong films on a giant television screen from the privacy of the car. It was also one of the few places in Jurong and across the island where it was suitable for family outings. However, as the novelty wore off coupled with challenges such as unpredictable weather and the proliferation of air-conditioned cinemas in shopping malls as well as other attractions, Jurong Drive-in cinema was forced to close its doors in 1985 after 15 years of operation.

### **Parks and Gardens of Jurong**

JTC also made sure that its housing estates were designed to have recreational areas and green spaces. During the planning phase, they set aside about 580 hectares of land, which is 12% of the total area, for parks, gardens, and other green areas. They also took into account the natural beauty of Jurong by creating a buffer zone in the upper Sungei Jurong area, separating the industrial and residential zones with trees, shrubs, and grassy fields. These initiatives not only added a touch of green to Jurong's industrial landscape but also preserved a part of the area's natural heritage.

| [Jurong Bird Park](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=e1852169-c5de-44ab-b794-c0635c8f0b89), which opened on 3 January 1971, was Asia's largest bird park and home to more than 5,000 birds across 400 species. Built at a cost of S$3.5 million, the 20.2-hectare  park draws about 800,000 visitors annually. The park was the vision of then Minister for Finance, Goh Keng Swee, who was inspired by a visit to the Rio Aviary in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during a World Bank meeting in 1967. Recognising the value of a bird park as a recreational attraction during a period of rapid industrialisation and urbanisation in Jurong and the rest of Singapore, he proposed its creation in 1968. The park, designed by John Yealland and J. Toovey, was located on the western slope of Jurong Hil, and it attracted visitors from around the world when it opened its doors. Over the years, it introduced many exhibits including immersive walk-in aviaries such as Lory Loft, Jungle Jewels and Waterfall Aviary. In 2014, plans were announced to relocate the park to Mandai to be part of a larger precinct of nature-themed attractions called Mandai Wildlife Reserve. This led to the closure of Jurong Bird Park in January 2023 and its reopening as Bird Paradise on 8 May 2023.

| The [Chinese Garden](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=f7c83ad6-8985-4027-b203-63409d028204) in Jurong was constructed by the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) in 1975 as part of the broader development plan for Jurong Park. The concept, dating back to 1968, included the creation of a green belt with landscaped gardens, a lake, and open spaces, with three islands designated for a Chinese garden, a Japanese garden, and a tropical garden. The design concept for the Chinese Garden was developed by Taiwanese expert Yu Yuen Chen, drawing inspiration from northern Chinese imperial architecture during the Song dynasty and the Summer Palace in Beijing. Notable features of the garden include marble stone lions, the 13-arch White Rainbow Bridge, an Arch and Main Gate complex, a Stone Boat and Tea House, and a seven-story pagoda. Over the years, the garden has seen additions, such as a Bonsai Garden and the Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum, and has become a popular location for Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, featuring large-scale festive displays.

| Jurong Lake came into existence during the development of the Jurong Industrial Estate in the 1960s. It was created by damming a section of Sungei Jurong to form a reservoir. This reservoir served the dual purpose of supplying water for industrial needs and providing a recreational area for the residents living nearby as Jurong Lake Park was developed on the western bank of the lake, while the Chinese Garden, the Japanese Garden and the Jurong Gountry Club were created from three man-made islets within the reservoir.

| The Singapore Science Centre opened its doors to the public on 10 December 1977. Built at the cost of S$20 million, the it was set up to promote interest and learning in science and technology to students and the general public. This objective came at a time when Singapore was industrialising rapidly and going up the technology ladder was all-important. The Centre was located off Jurong Town Hall Road near the eastern bank of Jurong Lake. Over the next decades, the Singapore Science Centre underwent several expansions. One major expansion was the opening of Omni-Theatre in 1987. This was followed by others including the opening of an observatory in 1989 and Snowcity in 2000. To mark its 30th anniversary in 2007, the Singapore Science Centre was renamed the Science Centre Singapore.

| Jurong Hill Park is situated on Jurong Hill. At the time of its opening in 1970, the park featured a three-story observatory tower that provided its visitors including foreign guests and investors invited by the government a panoramic view of the nearby Jurong Industrial Estate. The tower also housed a restaurant, which, unfortunately, closed down in 1976 due to poor business. Besides the observatory tower, there was also a landscaped garden with footpaths, benches, refreshment kiosks, public restrooms, and a "Garden of Fame". The latter where foreign dignitaries like Queen Elizabeth II, Deng Xiaoping, and Dr. Albert Winsemius had planted trees there between 1969 and 1984. In total, 30 trees were planted before the Garden was relocated to the compound of Jurong Town Hall.
