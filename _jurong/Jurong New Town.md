Development of Jurong New Town

Jurong has long suffered from a perception that it stands locked in a distant corner of the island, too far from everything else even on a little red dot like Singapore. This was the case in the 1960s, when even a plentiful supply of jobs in the new industrial town made little headway in attracting people to work and live there. By 1969, the resident population of Jurong stood at about 16,000, living in flats and shophouses built by the Housing & Development Board (HDB) in Taman Jurong. 

The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) took over responsibility for building and maintaining flats in 1969, and began to build executive and three-room flats to provide a wider array of housing choices.

More variety in flat sizes and designs followed, and the JTC was charged with the growth of Jurong as a residential town as well as balancing environmental and industrial pressures. By 1982, the responsibility for the residential aspect of Jurong was returned to the HDB.

The JTC tailored its new land and factory development to ever evolving economic needs, and part of this also involved establishing new leisure attractions, amenities and industrial facilities, a number of which have become closely associated with the new Jurong. At the planning stage, some 580ha of land, or 12% of the total, was slated for parks, gardens and other green spaces. The natural heritage of Jurong was also considered, with the upper Sungei Jurong area demarcated as a buffer zone between the industrial and residential areas. Tracts of trees, shrubbery and grass field also separated the two areas. These efforts added a green aspect to the industrial character of Jurong, while also preserving a slice of the areaâ€™s natural heritage.
