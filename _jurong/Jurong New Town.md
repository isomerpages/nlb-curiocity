In less than one decade after the launch of the Jurong Industrial Estate, Jurong grew into a bustling hub of factories and workers, and was the centerpiece of Singapore’s industrialisation efforts. The estate had attracted investments worth a total of about S$178 million in fixed assets and generated jobs for around 6,500 workers. However, Dr Goh Keng Swee wanted Jurong to not only be an industrial estate, but also a town. This led to the birth of housing estates in Jurong and the building of recreational facilities, town centres, and flats.

### **Development of Housing Estates in Jurong**

Although the rapid development of Jurong industrial estate created a steady supply of jobs, it made little headway in attracting people to live there. One factor was due to the perception of its location that it stands locked in a distant corner of the island, too far from everything else. To address this, measures were taken from the late 1960s to make Jurong more liveable. These included offering more options in public housing, as well as the building of shops, social amenities, recreation spaces, and a better transportation system.

The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) was the agency that spearheaded the effort to improve the attractiveness of Jurong for home seekers, and the first housing estates it built included Taman Jurong from 1968, as well as Boon Lay Gardens, Teban Gardens and Pandan Gardens in the 1970s. Originally referred to as Neighbourhood I, II, III and IV respectively, these estates were located farther away from the heavy and medium industries along the coast by the throughway, Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim. JTC also provided bigger housing choices for new home seekers in these estates by building more three-room and executive flats rather than low-cost one- and two-room flats. In fact, JTC ceased the construction of one- and two-room flats when it began developing Boon Lay Gardens, Teban Gardens and Pandan Gardens.

Besides offering bigger housing choices, JTC also supplemented them with amenities such as Community Centres and playgrounds.

By 1982, the responsibility for the residential aspect of Jurong was returned to the HDB. By 1969, the resident population of Jurong stood at about 16,000, living in flats and shophouses built by the Housing & Development Board (HDB) in Taman Jurong.

JTC also tailored the design of its housing estates to include spaces for recreational and greenery. At the planning stage, some 580ha of land, or 12% of the total, was slated for parks, gardens and other green spaces. The natural heritage of Jurong was also considered, with the upper Sungei Jurong area demarcated as a buffer zone between the industrial and residential areas. Tracts of trees, shrubbery and grass field also separated the two areas. These efforts added a green aspect to the industrial character of Jurong, while also preserving a slice of the area’s natural heritage.

### **Recreation Spaces in Jurong**

[Jurong Bird Park](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=e1852169-c5de-44ab-b794-c0635c8f0b89), which opened on 3 January 1971, was Asia's largest bird park and home to more than 5,000 birds across 400 species. Built at a cost of S$3.5 million, the 20.2-hectare  park draws about 800,000 visitors annually. The park was the vision of then Minister for Finance, Goh Keng Swee, who was inspired by a visit to the Rio Aviary in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during a World Bank meeting in 1967. Recognising the value of a bird park as a recreational attraction during a period of rapid industrialisation and urbanisation in Jurong and the rest of Singapore, he proposed its creation in 1968. The park, designed by John Yealland and J. Toovey, was located on the western slope of Jurong Hil, and it attracted visitors from around the world when it opened its doors. Over the years, it introduced many exhibits including immersive walk-in aviaries such as Lory Loft, Jungle Jewels and Waterfall Aviary. In 2014, plans were announced to relocate the park to Mandai to be part of a larger precinct of nature-themed attractions called Mandai Wildlife Reserve. This led to the closure of Jurong Bird Park in January 2023 and its reopening as Bird Paradise on 8 May 2023.

[Jurong Drive-in](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=bbfab240-c8be-4315-a0de-959b7dc0a0fe) is Singapore's first open-air cinema. Opened on 14 July 1971 by then Minister of Culture, Jek Yuen Thong, it was once located next to the Japanese Gardens. Conceived by Cathay Organisation, it was the largest drive-in cinema in Asia and could accommodate 900 cars as well as an additional 300 people in its walk-in gallery. The cinema offered a unique movie-watching experience for movie-goers, as they could watch English and Hong Kong films on a giant television screen from the privacy of the car. It was also one of the few places in Jurong and across the island where it was suitable for family outings. However, as the novelty wore off coupled with challenges such as unpredictable weather and the proliferation of air-conditioned cinemas in shopping malls as well as other attractions, Jurong Drive-in cinema was forced to close its doors in 1985 after 15 years of operation.

The [Chinese Garden](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=f7c83ad6-8985-4027-b203-63409d028204) in Jurong was constructed by the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) in 1975 as part of the broader development plan for Jurong Park. The concept, dating back to 1968, included the creation of a green belt with landscaped gardens, a lake, and open spaces, with three islands designated for a Chinese garden, a Japanese garden, and a tropical garden. The design concept for the Chinese Garden was developed by Taiwanese expert Yu Yuen Chen, drawing inspiration from northern Chinese imperial architecture during the Song dynasty and the Summer Palace in Beijing. Notable features of the garden include marble stone lions, the 13-arch White Rainbow Bridge, an Arch and Main Gate complex, a Stone Boat and Tea House, and a seven-story pagoda. Over the years, the garden has seen additions, such as a Bonsai Garden and the Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum, and has become a popular location for Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, featuring large-scale festive displays.
