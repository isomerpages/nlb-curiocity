In just three years, Jurong grew into a bustling hub of factories and workers, and was the centerpiece of Singapore’s industrialisation efforts. By late-1967, Jurong Industrial Estate had attracted investments worth a total of about S$178 million in fixed assets and generated jobs for around 6,500 workers. However, Dr Goh saw Jurong as an entire town, and more than just a collction of factories. He said that “life in Jurong cannot be other than spartan”. Thus, JTC also oversaw the construction of recreational facilities, a town centre, and flats to cater to the growing population in Jurong Town. Over the years, these extended to include the Jurong Bird Park, Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden and Jurong Park, Roads, sporting facilities and hospitals were also constructed.

### **Development of Housing Estates in Jurong**

Although the rapid development of Jurong industrial estate created a steady supply of jobs, it made little headway in attracting people to live there. One factor was due to the perception of its location that it stands locked in a distant corner of the island, too far from everything else. To address this, measures were taken from the late 1960s to make Jurong more liveable. These included offering more options in public housing, as well as the building of shops, social amenities, recreation spaces, and a better transportation system.

The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) was the agency that spearheaded the effort to improve the attractiveness of Jurong for home seekers, and the first housing estates it built included Taman Jurong from 1968, as well as Boon Lay Gardens, Teban Gardens and Pandan Gardens in the 1970s. Originally referred to as Neighbourhood I, II, III and IV respectively, these estates were located farther away from the heavy and medium industries along the coast by the throughway, Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim. JTC also provided bigger housing choices for new home seekers in these estates by building more three-room and executive flats rather than low-cost one- and two-room flats. In fact, JTC ceased the construction of one- and two-room flats when it began developing Boon Lay Gardens, Teban Gardens and Pandan Gardens.

Besides offering bigger housing choices, JTC also supplemented them with amenities such as Community Centres and playgrounds.

By 1982, the responsibility for the residential aspect of Jurong was returned to the HDB. By 1969, the resident population of Jurong stood at about 16,000, living in flats and shophouses built by the Housing & Development Board (HDB) in Taman Jurong.

JTC also tailored the design of its housing estates to include spaces for recreational and greenery. At the planning stage, some 580ha of land, or 12% of the total, was slated for parks, gardens and other green spaces. The natural heritage of Jurong was also considered, with the upper Sungei Jurong area demarcated as a buffer zone between the industrial and residential areas. Tracts of trees, shrubbery and grass field also separated the two areas. These efforts added a green aspect to the industrial character of Jurong, while also preserving a slice of the area’s natural heritage.
