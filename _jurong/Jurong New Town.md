In just three years, Jurong grew into a bustling hub of factories and workers, and was the centerpiece of Singapore’s industrialisation efforts. By late-1967, Jurong Industrial Estate had attracted investments worth a total of about S$178 million in fixed assets and generated jobs for around 6,500 workers. However, Dr Goh saw Jurong as an entire town, and more than just a collction of factories. He said that “life in Jurong cannot be other than spartan”. Thus, JTC also oversaw the construction of recreational facilities, a town centre, and flats to cater to the growing population in Jurong Town. Over the years, these extended to include the Jurong Bird Park, Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden and Jurong Park, Roads, stadiums and hospitals were also constructed.

### **Development of Jurong New Town**

Although the rapid development of Jurong industrial estate had created a steady supply of jobs, it made little headway in attracting people to live there. One factor was due to the perception of its location that it stands locked in a distant corner of the island, too far from everything else. To address this, measures were taken from the late 1960s to not only build better housing in Jurong, but also supplement it with shops, social amenities and recreation spaces.

The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) was the agency that spearheaded the effort to improve the attractiveness of Jurong as a housing estate.  for building and maintaining flats in 1969, and began to build executive and three-room flats to provide a wider array of housing choices.

More variety in flat sizes and designs followed, and the JTC was charged with the growth of Jurong as a residential town as well as balancing environmental and industrial pressures. By 1982, the responsibility for the residential aspect of Jurong was returned to the HDB. 

By 1969, the resident population of Jurong stood at about 16,000, living in flats and shophouses built by the Housing & Development Board (HDB) in Taman Jurong.

The JTC tailored its new land and factory development to ever evolving economic needs, and part of this also involved establishing new leisure attractions, amenities and industrial facilities, a number of which have become closely associated with the new Jurong. At the planning stage, some 580ha of land, or 12% of the total, was slated for parks, gardens and other green spaces. The natural heritage of Jurong was also considered, with the upper Sungei Jurong area demarcated as a buffer zone between the industrial and residential areas. Tracts of trees, shrubbery and grass field also separated the two areas. These efforts added a green aspect to the industrial character of Jurong, while also preserving a slice of the area’s natural heritage.
