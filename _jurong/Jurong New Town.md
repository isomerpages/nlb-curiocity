In less than one decade after the launch of the Jurong Industrial Estate, Jurong grew into a bustling hub of factories and workers, and was the centerpiece of Singapore’s industrialisation efforts. The estate had attracted investments worth a total of about S$178 million in fixed assets and generated jobs for around 6,500 workers. However, Dr Goh Keng Swee wanted Jurong to not only be an industrial estate, but also a town. This led to the birth of housing estates in Jurong and the building of recreational facilities, town centres, and flats.

### **Development of Housing Estates in Jurong**

Even though Jurong industrial estate grew quickly and provided many jobs, not many people wanted to live there. One reason for this was that it seemed far away from the rest of the island, making it less appealing. To make Jurong a better place to live, starting in the late 1960s, efforts were made to improve it. They added more housing choices, built shops, social places, places to have fun, and made transportation better.

The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) led the effort to make Jurong a more appealing place for people looking for homes. They started by building the first housing estates like Taman Jurong in 1968, followed by Boon Lay Gardens, Teban Gardens, and Pandan Gardens in the 1970s. These estates were initially called Neighbourhood I, II, III, and IV. They were situated farther away from the heavy and medium industries along the coast near Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim road. JTC also offered more housing choices for new home seekers in these estates by constructing more three-room and executive flats instead of the smaller one- and two-room flats. In fact, JTC stopped building one- and two-room flats when they started developing Boon Lay Gardens, Teban Gardens, and Pandan Gardens.

Besides offering bigger housing choices, JTC also supplemented them with shops as well as amenities such as Community Centres and playgrounds.

JTC also made sure that its housing estates were designed to have recreational areas and green spaces. During the planning phase, they set aside about 580 hectares of land, which is 12% of the total area, for parks, gardens, and other green areas. They also took into account the natural beauty of Jurong by creating a buffer zone in the upper Sungei Jurong area, separating the industrial and residential zones with trees, shrubs, and grassy fields. These initiatives not only added a touch of green to Jurong's industrial landscape but also preserved a part of the area's natural heritage.

### **Recreation Spaces in Jurong**

[Jurong Bird Park](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=e1852169-c5de-44ab-b794-c0635c8f0b89), which opened on 3 January 1971, was Asia's largest bird park and home to more than 5,000 birds across 400 species. Built at a cost of S$3.5 million, the 20.2-hectare  park draws about 800,000 visitors annually. The park was the vision of then Minister for Finance, Goh Keng Swee, who was inspired by a visit to the Rio Aviary in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during a World Bank meeting in 1967. Recognising the value of a bird park as a recreational attraction during a period of rapid industrialisation and urbanisation in Jurong and the rest of Singapore, he proposed its creation in 1968. The park, designed by John Yealland and J. Toovey, was located on the western slope of Jurong Hil, and it attracted visitors from around the world when it opened its doors. Over the years, it introduced many exhibits including immersive walk-in aviaries such as Lory Loft, Jungle Jewels and Waterfall Aviary. In 2014, plans were announced to relocate the park to Mandai to be part of a larger precinct of nature-themed attractions called Mandai Wildlife Reserve. This led to the closure of Jurong Bird Park in January 2023 and its reopening as Bird Paradise on 8 May 2023.

[Jurong Drive-in](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=bbfab240-c8be-4315-a0de-959b7dc0a0fe) is Singapore's first open-air cinema. Opened on 14 July 1971 by then Minister of Culture, Jek Yuen Thong, it was once located next to the Japanese Gardens. Conceived by Cathay Organisation, it was the largest drive-in cinema in Asia and could accommodate 900 cars as well as an additional 300 people in its walk-in gallery. The cinema offered a unique movie-watching experience for movie-goers, as they could watch English and Hong Kong films on a giant television screen from the privacy of the car. It was also one of the few places in Jurong and across the island where it was suitable for family outings. However, as the novelty wore off coupled with challenges such as unpredictable weather and the proliferation of air-conditioned cinemas in shopping malls as well as other attractions, Jurong Drive-in cinema was forced to close its doors in 1985 after 15 years of operation.

The [Chinese Garden](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=f7c83ad6-8985-4027-b203-63409d028204) in Jurong was constructed by the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) in 1975 as part of the broader development plan for Jurong Park. The concept, dating back to 1968, included the creation of a green belt with landscaped gardens, a lake, and open spaces, with three islands designated for a Chinese garden, a Japanese garden, and a tropical garden. The design concept for the Chinese Garden was developed by Taiwanese expert Yu Yuen Chen, drawing inspiration from northern Chinese imperial architecture during the Song dynasty and the Summer Palace in Beijing. Notable features of the garden include marble stone lions, the 13-arch White Rainbow Bridge, an Arch and Main Gate complex, a Stone Boat and Tea House, and a seven-story pagoda. Over the years, the garden has seen additions, such as a Bonsai Garden and the Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum, and has become a popular location for Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, featuring large-scale festive displays.
