The heartland, when referring to the planning subdivisions of Singapore, refers to the HDB (Housing Development Board) estates such as Jurong, Toa Payoh or Woodlands. 

‘Heartland’ refers to the different planning areas in suburban Singapore with concentrated subsidised public housing. They are very much self-contained residential areas with markets, shopping malls, cinema complex, restaurants and cafes, schools. Some of these heartlands have transformed into regional business centres. A very good example is the award-winning estate, Tampines in the northeast of the island.
