The Story Maps here tell the incredible stories that are embedded in the map collections of the National Library and National Archives of Singapore. Utilising maps, text and multimedia, they offer an interactive and engaging way to learn about the history of Singapore particularly its urban transformation.

To help you navigate through our collection of Story Maps, we have categorised them into the following areas.

|**<font size="5">[The Central Area](/story-maps/central-area)</font>** |  | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| <img src="/images/banner-green-and-blue-of-kallang.jpg" alt="qr-code-storymap-bridges-singapore-river" style="width:1000px;" />   | Also referred to as the city centre, this area is both the economic and historic heart of Singapore. Comprising 11 Planning Areas including Singapore River, Orchard and Downtown Core, its cityscape of both modern skyscrapers and heritage buildings is a narrative of Singaporeâ€™s progress from a colonial outpost to a global financial and business hub.   | **

Populated mostly by public housing, they are self-sufficient housing estates completed with amenities ranging from schools, shops, markets, cinemas, stadiums, shopping malls and places of worship. It is also the part of the island where most of its parks and greenery were located.       |
