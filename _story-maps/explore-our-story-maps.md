The Story Maps here tell the incredible stories that are embedded in the map collections of the National Library and National Archives of Singapore. Utilising maps, text and multimedia, they offer an interactive and engaging way to learn about the history of Singapore particularly its urban transformation.

To help you navigate through our collection of Story Maps, we have categorised them into the following topics:

* The Central Area: 

	Comprising the 11 Planning Areas of Outram, Museum, Newton, River Valley, Singapore River, Marina South, Marina East, Straits View,  Rochor, Orchard and Downtown Core, the Central Area is both the economic and historical heart of Singapore. Having a mix of modern and heritage buildings, this area creates a unique cityscape that attests us to our vibrant and plural history, as well as our economic progress from colonial outpost to a thriving global financial and business hub.
