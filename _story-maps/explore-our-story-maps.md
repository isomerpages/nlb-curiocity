The Story Maps here tell the incredible stories that are embedded in the map collections of the National Library and National Archives of Singapore. Utilising maps, text and multimedia, they offer an interactive and engaging way to learn about the history of Singapore particularly its urban transformation.

To help you navigate through our collection of Story Maps, we have categorised them into the following areas.

| **The Central Area** |  | 
| -------- | -------- |

Comprising 11 Planning Areas including Singapore River, Orchard and Downtown Core, its cityscape of both modern skyscrapers and heritage buildings is a narrative of Singapore’s progress from a colonial outpost to a global financial and business hub.   | 

| **The Heartland** |  | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| <img src="/images/banner-green-and-blue-of-kallang.jpg" alt="qr-code-storymap-bridges-singapore-river" style="width:600px;" />   | 'Heartland' refers to areas beyond the city centre, outside of the Central Area. Populated mostly by public housing, they are self-sufficient housing estates completed with amenities ranging from schools, shops, markets, cinemas, stadiums, shopping malls and places of worship. It is also the part of the island where most of its parks and greenery were located.       | 

| **Beyond the Boundaries** |  | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| <img src="/images/banner-green-and-blue-of-kallang.jpg" alt="qr-code-storymap-bridges-singapore-river" style="width:600px;" />      | Comprising the 11 Planning Areas of Outram, Museum, Newton, River Valley, Singapore River, Marina South, Marina East, Straits View,  Rochor, Orchard and Downtown Core, the Central Area is both the economic and historic heart of Singapore. Having a mix of both modern and heritage buildings, this area creates a unique cityscape that attests us to our vibrant and plural history, as well as our economic progress from colonial outpost to a thriving global financial and business hub.       |
