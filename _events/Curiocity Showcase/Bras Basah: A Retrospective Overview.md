Bras Basah is among the oldest districts in Singapore. Situated within the European part of [Sir Stamford Raffles’s](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_715_2004-12-15.html) 1822 plan for the town of Singapore or the [Raffles Town Plan](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_658_2005-01-07.html), it served as the suburb to the busy city centre which wrapped itself around [Commercial Square](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_864_2004-12-30.html) (now known as Raffles Place). Over the next two centuries, Bras Basah would grow spectacularly resulting in the establishments of schools, religious buildings and some of the finest colonial structures in Singapore.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: italic; color:#353839">The name “Bras Basah” has existed since the early 1800s. In old maps, it was also spelt as “Brass Bassa”...The name “Bras Basah” itself is a mistranscription of the Malay term “beras basah” (“wet rice”). Such mistranscriptions arise when non-native Malay speakers anglicise names based on what is verbally heard...Speaking of rice, Singapore in the old days had paddy fields...Wet harvested rice from these paddy fields (which practised wet-rice cultivation) would have been transported along Selegie Road and then dried on patches of undeveloped land around Sungai Bras Basah. (Drying is critical after harvesting a rice crop because it reduces grain moisture content to a safe level for storage.) This scenario eventually gave birth to the toponym “Bras Basah” for the area. </span>

The <a href="http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/stweekly18920216-1.2.23/">Straits Times Weekly</a> (1892) explains the story behind it.</span></summary>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: italic; color:#353839">What is known as “decayed rice” is, as a matter of fact, rare now. At one time when rice was brought to Singapore in sailing vessels, it was no uncommon thing for it to become saturated and rotten, and in this state it smelled abominably. So much was this the case that it had by law to be unloaded from the ships to a spot out of the then town and hence Brasssbassa (bras basah) Road got its name.	</span>
