Given the close proximity of Bras Basah to the town centre and ever-growing multicultural communities that have taken roots within, it is no surprise that the area was considered an ideal location for the establishment of entertainment spots, schools and other public buildings and spaces. This section explores some of these places.

#### **Former Places of Entertainment**

There were also many recreation spaces including playing fields in Bras Basah during the colonial period. Its prime location also gave rise to a conglomeration of entertainment sites including cinemas, hotels, clubs and cafes. Frequented by the British as well as the locals, these establishments were located in splendid colonial buildings designed some of the best architectural firms at the time.

#### **A District of Books and Knowledge, Too**

Mention Bras Basah Road to a Singaporean who lived through the 1970s and “books, stationery and printing services” are among the words which may spring to mind. Back then, the road which houses today’s Bras Basah Complex was identifiable with two rows of shophouses, famous for such services. Together with other education institutions in the area such as the National Museum and the National Library, the Bras Basah area was a place of knowledge and learning.
