Given the close proximity of Bras Basah to the town centre and the ever-growing multicultural communities that have taken roots within, it is no surprise that the area was considered an ideal location for the establishment of not only recreation and entertainment places, but also schools, retail shops, restaurants and places of worship. Although many of these establishments were created during the pre-war period, those that are still around continue to be popular even up to this day.

#### **Places of Entertainment and Recreation**

Ranging from cinemas and hotels to clubs and cultural institutions, Bras Basah was a place frequented by people in search of entertainment and recreation during the colonial period and nation-building years. While some of these places are no longer around, many still remain and are frequented by people from the current generation. 

The story map below lays out some of these places in Bras Basah.

Besides the story map, these entertainment and recreation spaces were also featured in historical audiovisual materials from the past available at the National Archives of Singapore or websites, blogs or social media channels maintained by heritage experts including the YouTube channel of Dutch photographer [Michael Rogge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCrh2WbJCp4&list=PLEF0C03E544562464).

#### **A Place for Books**

Mention Bras Basah Road to a Singaporean who lived through the 1970s and “books, stationery and printing services” are among the words which may spring to mind. Back then, the road and those nearby such as North Bridge Road and Stamford Road used to house shophouses famous for such services. Some of the biggest names that once stood there included the Methodist Publishing House (MPH), Shanghai Book Company and Popular Bookstore.

Take a look at these bookstores through the photo essay below.

**The Schools of Bras Basah**

The students that usually thronged the bookshops along Bras Basah Road and North Bridge Road were from schools across the island as well as those within Bras Basah. The story map below shows where these Bras Basah schools were once located in the district.

[![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-storymap-schools-2.jpg)](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/04f5c05311b7e48aadefd0cdd269c308/bras-basah-schools/index.html)

**Bras Basah Complex**

Towards the end of the 1970s, many bookstores along Bras Basah Road and North Bridge Road including Shanghai Book Company and Popular were moved to a new building known as Bras Basah Complex.

Located along Bain Street, the complex was built by the Housing and Development Board and was completed in 1979. It is made up of two blocks of 21-storey flats above an office-cum-shopping podium.

Today, the building still serves as a one-stop centre for educational books and art materials. During the 1980s, it was also a popular venue for Singapore "xinyao" singers to launch and promote their albums.

#### **A Place for Food, Too**

Other than being a place for entertainment and recreation, as well as books and learning, Bras Basah was also known for its restaurants, coffee shops and cafes. Patronised by students and residents either staying nearby or from different parts of the island, these places clearly show that Singapore's foodie culture has a history longer than most people think.

Below is a photo essay that highlights some of these eating places.

**Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant**

[![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-rendezvous-1.jpg)](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/8782abeb-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad)

Constructed during the early 1900s, these shophouses were located at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Prinsep Street. They were once occupied by a string of businesses that included a hotel, photography studios,  sport equipment shops, bookshops and coffe shops. The most famous of them was Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant. 

The family-run restaurant has been operating there since the 1930s and has been considered as one of Singapore's finest Nasi Padang restaurant. It was a popular haunt for both expatriates and locals since the pre-war period. 

Today, it is still located there within the premises of Hotel Rendezvous, the occupant of these shophouses which have been conserved by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in the late 1990s. In fact, so memorable was the presence of the restaurant that the hotel named itself after it.

**Stamford Cafe**

The Stamford Cafe was one of the places to go for good Western Food especially during the 1950s and 1960s. Located at...

**Long Bar and the Singapore Sling**

The Long Bar in Raffles Hotel was among the oldest establishments in the Bras Basah area.  With a history as old as the hotel itself, it was a popular haunt among plantation owners and was known as the ‘Rendezvous of Planters’. 

During its early days, it was not a formal bar, but rather tables placed next to another in the Cad Alley wing of the hotel facing Bras Basah Road for visitors to mingle and relax with drinks and snacks.

The bar is most well-known as the birthplace of the Singapore Sling which is an internationally recognised cocktail by the hotel's bartender Ngiam Tong Boon. Primarily a gin-based cocktail, Ngiam made the beverage pink so as to allow the ladies at the time to consume it in the public.

**Hainanese Chicken Rice and Coffee**

**Magnolia Snack Bar**

The snack bar was owned by the supermarket chain Cold Storage. During its heydays, the popular haunt had 20 branches spread across Singapore including Orchard Road. However, by 1988, all of them had winded up.

**Red House**

[![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-red-house-bakery-1.jpg)](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b021b6b5-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad)

The Red House Bakery is a popular reference to a relict confectionery shop, Katong Bakery & Confectionery. This bakery was a popular breakfast haunt among Singaporeans living in the eastern part of Singapore, especially for its signature cakes and curry puffs. It was established in 1925 and located at 75 East Coast Road. It was closed on 23 March 2003 after the shophouse where it was occupying was deemed as unsafe.

With a myriad of places for entertainment, recreation, books and food, Bras Basah was definitely a lively and bustling district full of activities in the past. This was vividly described by renowned local poet and academic Edwin Thumboo in his poem on Bras Basah in 1953 which is available in the <a href="https://www.singaporememory.sg/contents/SMB-7c36308f-e5d8-42a4-981a-b175738e7d4e">Singapore Memory Project portal</a>.

<font size="4">Where the first Rendezvous brooded by a row of old shophouses, since sadly slain, a special road began. A point of colonial Confluence: Dhoby Ghaut, the YWCA with manicured tennis lawns for memsahibs who then took tea and scones. Across a Shell kiosk where Papa parked his Austin Seven, then off to Hock Hoe’s for piston rods and Radex.</font>

Think of the names: Dhoby Ghaut, Prinsep St, the three Cathays, a name the Lokes made famous: resplendent building, our tallest then; fantastic camera shop; and that popular Store where Rudy’s wife, petite, temporarily demure, quietly assessed her customers as she held her intelligence above show-cases. Two doors away, Heng, increasingly called Mr, sold German cameras to Japanese sailors, was en route to a partnership.

And the bookshops full of stuff: Penguin New writing to Palgrave’s G-Treasury; Q’s Oxford Anthology, a blue spine among mouldy issues of The Wide World where imperial dreams, the White man’s burden trudged across Asia and Africa, up Ruwenzori’s mist and moon, then down The Brahmaputra. Mainly first-hand accounts, direct, unshorn, marching against superstition. Plain narratives rising in majesty, in power, art. No cute theory of the Other. Only them natives.

And the Rendezvous after school; affordable. The man with the mole, ladle in hand, presided, holding the extra spoonful, balanced fate, deciding if he liked you. Two doors away Simon Ong’s Family shop of fishing tackle, Winchester torches, Knives of Solingen steel. Outside, a Woodsville tram, full of St Andrew boys, swings around the corner, tires squealing.

Standing there, the world grew, bit by bit, seemed different with each fresh vantage shift in weather; hormonal stir, sweet unknowing; an ache that knew no words; a quickly passing mouth. As eyes caught more lit with sensuous guilt, when curves beneath Convent uniforms heaved and turned with the mind’s proposal, the rainbow’s ripening, as thoughts fingered image, each chance encounter. Experience became a word as Life cease to be simple.</font>
