Given the close proximity of Bras Basah to the town centre and ever-growing multicultural communities that have taken roots within, it is no surprise that the area was considered an ideal location for the establishment of not only recreation and entertainment places, but also schools, retail shops, restaurants and places of worship. Although many of these establishments were created during the pre-war period, they remained popular in the nation-building years.

#### **Former Places of Entertainment and Recreation**

Ranging from cinemas and hotels to clubs and cultural institutions, Bras Basah was a place frequented by people in search of entertainment and recreation during the colonial period and nation-building years. Click the story map below to see some of these places.

#### **A Place for Books**

Mention Bras Basah Road to a Singaporean who lived through the 1970s and “books, stationery and printing services” are among the words which may spring to mind. Back then, the road and those nearby such as North Bridge Road and Stamford Road used to house shophouses famous for such services. Some of the biggest names that once stood there included the Methodist Publishing House (MPH), Shanghai Book Company and Popular Bookstore.

Take a look at these bookstores through the photo essay below.

**Bras Basah Complex**

Bras Basah Complex was known as书城 (shu cheng, meaning “City of Books” in Mandarin) as the complex is famed for its numerous bookstores. It is also known as 百胜楼 (bai sheng lou in Mandarin). The complex consists of two blocks of 21-storey flats above a 4- & 5-storey office and shopping podium.

It was built by the Housing and Development Board and was completed in 1979.  It was home to many bookstores which used to operate at North Bridge Road and Bras Basah Road areas. Today, it still serves as a one-stop centre for educational books and art materials. Bras Basah Complex was also a popular venue for Singapore xinyao singers to launch and promote their albums in the 1980s.

**The Schools of Bras Basah**

The students that usually thronged the bookshops along Bras Basah Road and Victoria Street were those story map below shows where these schools were once located in Bras Basah.

#### **A Place for Food, Too**

Other than being a place for entertainment and recreation, as well as books and learning, Bras Basah was also known for its restaurants, coffee shops and cafes. Patronised by students and residents either staying nearby or from different parts of the island, these places clearly show that Singapore's foodie culture has a history longer than most people think.

Below is a photo essay that highlights some of these eating places.

**Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant**

[![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-rendezvous-1.jpg)](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/8782abeb-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad)

Constructed during the early 1900s, these shophouses were located at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Prinsep Street. They were once occupied by a string of businesses that included a hotel, photography studios,  sport equipment shops, bookshops and coffe shops. The most famous of them was Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant. 

The family-run restaurant has been operating there since the 1930s and has been considered as one of Singapore's finest Nasi Padang restaurant. It was a popular haunt for both expatriates and locals since the pre-war period. 

Today, it is still located there within the premises of Hotel Rendezvous, the occupant of these shophouses which have been conserved by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in the late 1990s. In fact, so memorable was the presence of the restaurant that the hotel named itself after it.

**Stamford Cafe**

The Stamford Cafe was one of the places to go for good Western Food especially during the 1950s and 1960s. Located at...

**Long Bar and the Singapore Sling**

**Hainanese Chicken Rice and Coffee**

**Magnolia Milk Bar**

**Red House**

**Jack's Place**

With a myriad of places for entertainment, recreation, books and food, Bras Basah was definitely a lively and bustling district full of activities in the past. This was vividly described by renowned local poet and academic Edwin Thumboo in his poem on Bras Basah in 1953 which is available in the <a href="https://www.singaporememory.sg/contents/SMB-7c36308f-e5d8-42a4-981a-b175738e7d4e">Singapore Memory Project portal</a>.

<font size="4">Where the first Rendezvous brooded by a row of old shophouses, since sadly slain, a special road began. A point of colonial Confluence: Dhoby Ghaut, the YWCA with manicured tennis lawns for memsahibs who then took tea and scones. Across a Shell kiosk where Papa parked his Austin Seven, then off to Hock Hoe’s for piston rods and Radex.</font>

Think of the names: Dhoby Ghaut, Prinsep St, the three Cathays, a name the Lokes made famous: resplendent building, our tallest then; fantastic camera shop; and that popular Store where Rudy’s wife, petite, temporarily demure, quietly assessed her customers as she held her intelligence above show-cases. Two doors away, Heng, increasingly called Mr, sold German cameras to Japanese sailors, was en route to a partnership.

And the bookshops full of stuff: Penguin New writing to Palgrave’s G-Treasury; Q’s Oxford Anthology, a blue spine among mouldy issues of The Wide World where imperial dreams, the White man’s burden trudged across Asia and Africa, up Ruwenzori’s mist and moon, then down The Brahmaputra. Mainly first-hand accounts, direct, unshorn, marching against superstition. Plain narratives rising in majesty, in power, art. No cute theory of the Other. Only them natives.

And the Rendezvous after school; affordable. The man with the mole, ladle in hand, presided, holding the extra spoonful, balanced fate, deciding if he liked you. Two doors away Simon Ong’s Family shop of fishing tackle, Winchester torches, Knives of Solingen steel. Outside, a Woodsville tram, full of St Andrew boys, swings around the corner, tires squealing.

Standing there, the world grew, bit by bit, seemed different with each fresh vantage shift in weather; hormonal stir, sweet unknowing; an ache that knew no words; a quickly passing mouth. As eyes caught more lit with sensuous guilt, when curves beneath Convent uniforms heaved and turned with the mind’s proposal, the rainbow’s ripening, as thoughts fingered image, each chance encounter. Experience became a word as Life cease to be simple.</font>
