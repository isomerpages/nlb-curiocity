The Bras Bash area under the Bras Basah.Bugis (BBB) Precinct is a living representation of a modern city that thrives on its vibrant and energetic creative communities while also treasuring the heritage that our forefathers have laid. A transliteration of the Malay words “beras basah” which mean “wet rice”, the history of this place is captured by the myraid of materials in the collections of not only the National Library Board, but also the National Heritage Board, and the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Take a look at the curated content below from Curiocity and Spatial Discovery to see some of them and the stories they embed.

<span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 24px; font-style: normal; color:#BA0C2F">Mention Bras Basah Complex and the very memories of my childhood days come naturally to my mind. You see, Bras Basah Complex is a significant place during my primary and secondary school days: twenty over years now and I still remember visiting the various book stores in Bras Basah Complex frequently, especially every November or December during my primary and secondary school days to buy new textbooks for the new year. Though it was then possible to buy new textbooks for the new school year from the school bookstores, somehow or rather, I prefer to visit Bras Basah Complex to buy these new textbooks due to the unrivalled experience of purchasing the textbooks from the complex. I mean which place in Singapore would allow you to enjoy the full realm of textbooks-buying experience apart from Brash Basah Complex? Buying my textbooks from the various bookstores in Bras Basah Complex was really a visual feast as I laid my eyes on the hundreds of new textbooks in the bookstores. I could even go so far as to say that the whole experience was also an olfactory one as I literally smelt the crispy pages of new textbooks!</span>
