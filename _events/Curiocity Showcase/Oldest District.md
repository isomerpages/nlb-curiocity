The Bras Bash area under the Bras Basah.Bugis (BBB) Precinct is a living representation of a modern city that thrives on its vibrant and energetic creative communities while also treasuring the heritage that our forefathers have laid. A transliteration of the Malay words “beras basah” which mean “wet rice”, the history of this place is captured by the myraid of materials in the collections of not only the National Library Board, but also the National Heritage Board, and the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Take a look at the curated content below from Curiocity and Spatial Discovery to see some of them and the stories they embed.
