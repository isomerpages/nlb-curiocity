#### **Bookstores Along Bras Basah Road**

Mention Bras Basah Road to a Singaporean who lived through the 1970s and “books, stationery and printing services” are among the words which may spring to mind. Back then, the road and those nearby such as North Bridge Road and Stamford Road used to house shophouses famous for such services. Some of the biggest names that once stood there included the Methodist Publishing House (MPH), Shanghai Book Company, Union Book Company and Popular Bookstore. Take a look at them through the photo essay below.

#### **Bras Basah Complex**

Towards the end of the 1970s, many bookstores along Bras Basah Road and North Bridge Road including Shanghai Book Company and Popular were moved to a new building known as Bras Basah Complex.

Located along Bain Street, the complex was built by the Housing and Development Board and was completed in 1979. It is made up of two blocks of 21-storey flats above an office-cum-shopping podium.

Today, the building still serves as a one-stop centre for educational books and art materials. During the 1980s, it was also a popular venue for Singapore "xinyao" singers to launch and promote their albums.
