##### **A Place for Entertainment and Recreation**

Ranging from cinemas and hotels to clubs and cultural institutions, Bras Basah was a place frequented by people in search of entertainment and recreation during the colonial period and nation-building years. While some of these places are no longer around, many still remain and are frequented by people from the current generation. 

The story map below lays out some of these places in Bras Basah.

#### **A Place for Food, Too**

Other than being a place for entertainment and recreation, as well as books and learning, Bras Basah was also known for its restaurants, coffee shops and cafes. Patronised by students and residents either staying nearby or from different parts of the island, these places clearly show that Singapore's foodie culture has a history longer than most people think.

Below is a photo essay that highlights some of these eating places.

**Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant**

Constructed during the early 1900s, these shophouses were located at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Prinsep Street. They were once occupied by a string of businesses that included a hotel, photography studios,  sport equipment shops, bookshops and coffe shops. The most famous of them was Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant. 

The family-run restaurant has been operating there since the 1930s and has been considered as one of Singapore's finest Nasi Padang restaurant. It was a popular haunt for both expatriates and locals since the pre-war period. 

Today, it is still located there within the premises of Hotel Rendezvous, the occupant of these shophouses which have been conserved by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in the late 1990s. In fact, so memorable was the presence of the restaurant that the hotel named itself after it.

**Stamford Cafe**

The Stamford Cafe was one of the places to go for good Western Food especially during the 1950s and 1960s. Located at...

**Long Bar and the Singapore Sling**

The Long Bar in Raffles Hotel was among the oldest establishments in the Bras Basah area.  With a history as old as the hotel itself, it was a popular haunt among plantation owners and was known as the ‘Rendezvous of Planters’. 

During its early days, it was not a formal bar, but rather tables placed next to another in the Cad Alley wing of the hotel facing Bras Basah Road for visitors to mingle and relax with drinks and snacks.

The bar is most well-known as the birthplace of the Singapore Sling which is an internationally recognised cocktail by the hotel's bartender Ngiam Tong Boon. Primarily a gin-based cocktail, Ngiam made the beverage pink so as to allow the ladies at the time to consume it in the public.

**Hainanese Chicken Rice and Coffee**

**Magnolia Snack Bar**
