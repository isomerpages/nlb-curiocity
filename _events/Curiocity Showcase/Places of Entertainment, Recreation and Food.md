##### **A Place for Entertainment and Recreation**

Ranging from cinemas and hotels to clubs and cultural institutions, Bras Basah was a place frequented by people in search of entertainment and recreation during the colonial period and nation-building years. While some of these places are no longer around, many still remain and are frequented by people from the current generation. 

The story map below lays out some of these places in Bras Basah.

Besides the story map, these entertainment and recreation spaces were also featured in historical audiovisual materials from the past available at the National Archives of Singapore or websites, blogs or social media channels maintained by heritage experts including the YouTube channel of Dutch photographer [Michael Rogge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCrh2WbJCp4&list=PLEF0C03E544562464).

#### **A Place for Food, Too**

Other than being a place for entertainment and recreation, as well as books and learning, Bras Basah was also known for its restaurants, coffee shops and cafes. Patronised by students and residents either staying nearby or from different parts of the island, these places clearly show that Singapore's foodie culture has a history longer than most people think.

Below is a photo essay that highlights some of these eating places.

**Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant**

The premises of today's Hotel Rendezvous  at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Prinsep Street was once occupied by a stretch of shophouses. Constructed during the early 1900s, they were known for their businesses which included a hotel, photography studios,  sport equipment shops, bookshops and coffe shops. The most famous of them, however, was Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant.

|Considered as one of Singapore's finest Nasi Padang restaurants then, it started off as a coffeeshop before becoming a pub and restaurant serving Chinese and Western food to British forces. |

**Long Bar and the Singapore Sling**

The Long Bar in Raffles Hotel was among the oldest food establishments in the Bras Basah area.  Sharing a history with the hotel itself, it was a popular haunt among plantation owners during the early 1900s and was commonly referred to as the ‘Rendezvous of Planters’ at the time.

Back then, Long Bar was not a formal bar. Rather it was just tables and chairs placed next to each other in the Cad Alley wing of the hotel facing Bras Basah Road. Visitors would use them to mingle and relax with drinks and snacks.

The bar is most well-known as the birthplace of the Singapore Sling which is an internationally recognised cocktail created by the hotel's bartender Ngiam Tong Boon in 1915. Primarily a gin-based cocktail, Ngiam made the beverage pink so as to allow the ladies at the time to consume it in the public.

**Street Hawkers**

During the pre-war years up till the late 1970s, the streets of Bras Basah, like many parts of the city area, were once lined with street hawkers. A trade that is considered as one of the most important components of our local heritage, food hawking has been around since the early 1800s, offering a livelihood for the early immigrants of Singapore.

https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b67c970b-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad 

The street hawkers of old Bras Basah could be found in places such as Middle Street and Queen Street. The former was lined with Malay and Javanese hawkers selling not only food like satay, but also crafts and curios. As for the latter, one could find Chinese hawkers selling cooked food and a variety of products such as food stuffs, vegetables and apparel.

Waterloo Street was another place in Bras Basah where street hawkers set up their stalls. Famous for its Indian rojak, the stalls that used to operate there were generations old, some with their origins stretching as far back as the late 1800s.



Watch the Channel NewsAsia documentary below to learn about our hawker centres came about.
