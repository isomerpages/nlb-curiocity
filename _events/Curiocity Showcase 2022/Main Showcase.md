#### **Psychic Cinema 2065**
**14 January – 3 February 2022**
<br>**The Plaza, National Library Building**

**About the installation**
<br>(PRE-EDITED) *Psychic Cinema 2065* explores an alternative cinema of the future through an immersive audio-visual installation reimagining the former Jubilee Theatre. Why do we watch films? Does each audience member have the same experience? How does our imagination augment what is on screen? This installation by design studio Space Objekt reframes the cinematic experience by diminishing one of the fundamental senses associated with it — sight. Employing light sequences and audio samples of heritage material from Singapore’s golden age of film, viewers conceive a unique film only they can ‘see’. A collective yet intimate encounter, this visceral work invites us to examine our relationship with cinema. 

**Behind the work**
<br>(PRE-EDITED) SPACE OBJEKT: We were drawn to this storied cinema’s colourful history as described in John Bertram Van Cuylenburg’s [Singapore: Through sunshine and shadow](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=4080104). Learning about Jubilee Theatre, its predecessor Tivoli, and how the site had an earlier incarnation as Harima Hall, got us thinking about the past and a speculative future. Reimagining it as a palimpsest where the past and future coexist, we wanted to take things further by exploring the nature of cinema itself. This led us to an anecdote in the book about the “thrilling silent pictures of the war” which “flickered badly” and were accompanied by “a screeching violin”. It painted such a vivid image of moviegoing in its time, we wanted our alternative cinema of the future to subvert it – blind pictures instead of silent ones, lights flickering even more intensely to disorientate, and letting the soundscape lead the cinematic experience.

To design our futuristic take on the cinema’s exterior facade, we referenced an archive image of [Jubilee Theatre](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/pictures/details/7c8de66e-a7ed-4463-b368-0017d7d7ba7a) from PictureSG. The Mandarin characters embellishing the installation are a wink to the many Chinese blockbusters screened there when Eng Wah acquired it in 1966 (as documented by Jan Uhde and Yvonne Ng Uhde in [Latent images: film in Singapore](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=13186916)).
