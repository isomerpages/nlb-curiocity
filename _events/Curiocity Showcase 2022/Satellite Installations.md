#### **The River Connects**
**14 January - 3 February 2022**
<br>**Asian Civilisations Museum (level 2)**

**About the installation:**
<br>*The River Connects* is an immersive media installation by artist Ong Kian Peng that highlights the bridges along the Singapore River. The title suggests the possibilities of human connection on and by the river — an organic phenomenon that can span mobility, commerce, and social interactions. Inspired by this notion, the work references the many ways of connecting through a collection of archival and 3D scanned images of the bridges — presenting the stories they hold in an interactive and experiential format, while imbuing the audience with new perspectives of the sights so familiar, yet so distant to us.

#### **A Tessellation of Memories**
**14 January - 3 February 2022**
<br>**The Arts House (Playden, level 2)**

**About the installation:**
<br>*A Tessellation of Memories* serves as a reflective journey into our city’s past, to piece together forgotten places from our history. Enter an imaginative realm and walk through six locales lost to time and the inevitable progression, before emerging to the present. Time stands, as one takes an intimate look into the places framed within an artful stream of infinity mirrors. Each is a reflection of its former self, glorious or otherwise, and beckons the audience to unearth a perspective unseen — until now.

#### **Lumba**
**14 January - 3 February 2022**
<br>**Esplanade Park (Queen Elizabeth Walk)**

**About the installation:**
<br>*Lumba* is an interactive light installation inspired by the small sailing boats as seen in kolek lumba — a sea sports activity once held during the New Year Regatta in the Civic District between 19th and early 20th century. Featuring five standing sculptures that resemble the boats, this creation by interaction designer Alina Ling invites all to observe how the fabric of the sails billow in sync with the wind — an important meteorological factor in sea sports. When night falls, walk through the spaces between the structures and see how one’s movement effects the dancing of light along their frames to conjure up a celebratory mood.
