#### **Cartographic Memories**
**14 January - 3 February 2022**
<br>**Asian Civilisations Museum (level 2)**
<br>Maps serve as a geographical and spatial guide, providing a way for us to relate our bodies to the world around us, but they are more than that. It serves as
archives of our collective and urban memories, bearing witness to the change
of the city over time. Cartographic Memories, by media artist Ong Kian Peng, is an audiovisual and interactive installation that borrows the cartographic mapping visual analogy to frame and present three distinct scenarios that represent the past and present of the region around the Singapore River.

#### **A Tessellation of Memories**
**14 January - 3 February 2022**
<br>**The Arts House (Playden, level 2)**
<br>Enter into a dark realm and get transported back in time,  lost in the dimension. Through memories in the Civic District, explore fragments of Singapore's social developments over the years and how life was like. This installation is created by interactive agency, Tribal Worldwide.


#### **LUMBA**
**14 January - 3 February 2022**
