#### **The River Connects**
**14 January – 3 February 2022**
<br>**Level 2 Foyer, Asian Civilisations Museum**

**About the installation**
<br>An immersive media installation by artist Ong Kian Peng, *The River Connects* highlights the bridges along the Singapore River. As its title suggests, this work explores the possibilities of human connection on and by the river — an organic phenomenon that can span mobility, commerce and social interactions. Inspired by this notion, The River Connects references the many ways of connecting through a collection of archival and 3D scanned images of the bridges. It presents the stories they hold in an interactive and experiential format, while giving the audience new perspectives of sights both familiar and yet distant.

#### **A Tessellation of Memories**
**14 January – 3 February 2022**
<br>**Play Den, The Arts House**

**About the installation**
<br>(PRE-EDITED) *A Tessellation of Memories* is a reflective journey into our city’s past, piecing together forgotten places from our history. Immerse yourself in an imaginative realm and revisit six locales lost to time. Observe their inevitable progression through time, before emerging in the present. Time stands still as you take an intimate look into each place framed within an artful stream of infinity mirrors. Each space is a reflection of its former self, glorious or otherwise, and invites its viewers to unearth a perspective unseen — until now.

**Behind the work**
<br>(PRE-EDITED) TRIBAL: In bringing to life these places, we pored over scores of old maps, photographs, articles and books. George D. Coleman’s [Map of the Town and Environs of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/f98c5272-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad) formed the foundation for all our findings; Yu-Mei Balasingamchow’s observation of the district documented in her [Rambling Around Bras Basah](https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/files/pdf/vol-13/v13-issue3_BrasBasah.pdf) article offered personal insights; and lastly, the portraitures by visitors from far and wide compiled in the [Travellers’ Tales of Old Singapore](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/WPAC/BIBENQ/272439404/324482546,1) book provided new, untold perspectives. These resources were invaluable in unveiling new facets to a district so familiar, yet so invisible to many of us — an outcome we hope to achieve for all our visitors.

#### **LUMBA**
**14 January – 3 February 2022**
<br>**Queen Elizabeth Walk, Esplanade Park**

**About the installation**
<br>*LUMBA* is an interactive light installation inspired by the small sailing boats in *kolek lumba* — a sea sport once held during the New Year Regatta in the Civic District between the 19th and early 20th centuries. Featuring five standing sculptures modelled after the boats, this creation by interaction designer Alina Ling invites all to observe how the sails billow in sync with the wind. When night falls, viewers can walk through the spaces between the structures and see how their movements affect the dancing of light along their frames to evoke a celebratory mood.

**Behind the work**
<br>(PRE-EDITED) ALINA: Looking at archival photographs of scenes at the “New Year Sea Sports”, it is important to first understand how racing koleks were operated in the past. Crew members were trained to manoeuvre the vessels in the meteorological conditions of the sea. The large sails would catch the wind, controlled by the crew standing on the gunwale perpendicular to the boat. While the boats glide elegantly towards the finishing point, crew members use their whole bodies with intense effort to balance the sails with the changing winds.

The structures in LUMBA capture the form of tilted sails in varying angles, all heading towards a common direction. Their shapes reference the different profiles of sails balancing on shell-like bases — as seen on the koleks. Bringing back the scene on Esplanade’s sea wall, the site-specific work pay homage to the historic event that marked the beginning of the new year. 

Each structure is illuminated with vibrant colours. Their lights gently pulsate on the fabric in the dark. The motion of light is designed to mimic the impact of wind upon the sails and the smooth gliding through water. As visitors walk around the structures, the colourful lights are triggered to move more dynamically to express the intensity of the sport and the excitement of the spectators. As the sequence comes to a close, the lights dance to evoke the celebratory spirit of the New Year.
