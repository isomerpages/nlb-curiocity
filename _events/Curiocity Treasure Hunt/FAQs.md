Q1) Am I allowed to participate in every weekly Hunt?
<br>A1) Yes, we welcome your entries for each and every hunt. However, do note that you are only allowed to submit only ONE answer, which will be tagged to your myLibrary username.

Q2) Do I need to run all over Singapore to look for clues?
A2) No. The 3 Hunts for each month will be localised to the specific area. If you wish, you can participate from home, or partner with friends and family members to maximise your chances of winning. But of course, we can only award prizes according to the myLibrary username submitted.

Q3) If I submit my answer on Saturday or Sunday, but forgot to borrow NLB books or ebooks, will I be disqualified?
A3) Yes. Rightfully, you need to borrow 4 books to qualify for the email clues sent to all registered participants. Even if you have somehow secured a clue from a friend or from the Internet, you will still need to borrow 4 NLB books or ebooks in order to be eligible as a winner.   

Q4) Do I need to be knowledgeable in Singapore History / Archaeology to be able to win?
A4) No. While possessing such knowledge may be advantageous in some cases, we have designed the weekly Hunts to be played by anyone aged 13 and above. (You did study Singapore History back in your school days, didn’t you?)

Q5) Can all the answers be found on the Internet?
A5) No. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be much of a challenge, would it? Some clues may require you to explore the designated locations to solve them.

Q6) What kind of vouchers are you giving away as prizes?
A6) Shopping and Book vouchers.

Q7) Can I exchange the vouchers for cash instead?
A7) Sorry, but that would not be possible. 

Q8) Can you split the prizes evenly between me and my friends? We worked on the clues together.
A8) No. We can only issue the prizes (vouchers) to the winners for each week, based on their myLibrary usernames.

Q9) Can I use my family members’ or friends’ myLibrary IDs to participate? They are not keen but gave me permission to do so. 
A9) Sorry, but you should only use your own myLibrary username. You may wish to encourage them to participate using their own myLibrary usernames instead. 

Q10) Are the weekly Hunts connected? Do I need to solve Hunts 1 and/or 2  in order to solve Hunt 3?
A10) No, each weekly Hunt is standalone, and is not connected to other Hunts.
