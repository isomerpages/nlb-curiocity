<summary><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000000">Q1) Am I allowed to participate in every weekly Hunt?</span></summary>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:normal">Yes, we welcome your entries for each and every hunt. However, do note that you are only allowed to submit only ONE answer, which will be tagged to your <a href="https://mobileapp.nlb.gov.sg/get-started-with/mylibrary" target="_blank">myLibrary</a> username.</span>

<summary><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000000">Q2) Do I need to run all over Singapore to look for clues?</span></summary>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:normal">No. The 3 Hunts for each month will be localised to the specific area. If you wish, you can participate from home, or partner with friends and family members to maximise your chances of winning. But of course, we can only award prizes according to the myLibrary username submitted.</span>

<summary><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000000">Q3) If I submit my answer on Saturday or Sunday, but forgot to borrow NLB books or ebooks, will I be disqualified?</span></summary>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:normal">Yes. Rightfully, you need to borrow 4 books to qualify for the email clues sent to all registered participants. Even if you have somehow secured a clue from a friend or from the Internet, you will still need to borrow 4 NLB books or ebooks in order to be eligible as a winner. </span>

<summary><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000000">Q4) Do I need to be knowledgeable in Singapore History / Archaeology to be able to win?</span></summary>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:normal">No. While possessing such knowledge may be advantageous in some cases, we have designed the weekly Hunts to be played by anyone aged 13 and above. (You did study Singapore History back in your school days, didn’t you?)</span>

<summary><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000000">Q5) Can all the answers be found on the Internet?</span></summary>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:normal">No. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be much of a challenge, would it? Some clues may require you to explore the designated locations to solve them.</span>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:normal">No. We can only issue the prizes (vouchers) to the winners for each week, based on their myLibrary usernames.</span>

<summary><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#000000">Q10) Are the weekly Hunts connected? Do I need to solve Hunts 1 and/or 2  in order to solve Hunt 3?</span></summary>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:normal">No, each weekly Hunt is standalone, and is not connected to other Hunts.</span>
