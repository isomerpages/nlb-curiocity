**Each weekly hunt will take place as follows:**

1. Borrow at least 4 NLB books or ebooks via our NLB Mobile App.
2. Go to the “Points & Rewards” section of the app and redeem for the Treasure Hunt clues for the week.
3. Clues will be sent to your registered email address. This may take some time. Do check your spam folder if the clues are not in your inbox.
4. Every Wednesday: There will be an additional special clue dropped on our social media platforms. Do check National Library's [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/NationalLibrarysg){:target="_blank"}  and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NationalLibrarySG){:target="_blank"}  accounts for the additional clue. Pro Tip: Subscribe to our social media pages so you can get alerts and be the first to receive the special clue!
5. Solve the clues using our Curiocity resources. Think you got all the answers? Submit them **[HERE](https://curiocity.nlb.gov.sg/events/curiocity-treasure-hunt/submission)** and stand a chance to win attractive prizes. Remember to submit them before the closing date for that week.
6. Every week, new hunts will begin and there will be new clues to be solved, which only means there are more prizes to be won!
