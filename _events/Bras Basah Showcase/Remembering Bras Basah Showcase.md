Bras Basah is one of the oldest districts of Singapore. Charmed with a unique mix of the rich heritage of Singapore's past and the modernity of art and architecture, BBB is a living representation of a modern city that thrives on its vibrant past and energetic future. However, to understand what Bras Basah is really about, we have to transcend beyond its built heritage and enter a realm where the myriad of resources on Bras Basah's past such as photographs, paintings, postcards, maps and memories could stir curiosity in the younger generation and nostalgia in the older generation thus helping us to discover and rediscover this historical district.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#353839">Where the first Rendezvous brooded
<br>By a row of old shophouses, since sadly slain,
<br>A special road began. A point of colonial
<br>Confluence: Dhoby Ghaut, the YWCA with
<br>Manicured tennis lawns for memsahibs who
<br>Then took tea and scones. Across a Shell kiosk
<br>Where Papa parked his Austin Seven, then off
<br>To Hock Hoe’s for piston rods and Radex
<br>
<br>Think of the names: Dhoby Ghaut, Prinsep St,
<br>The three Cathays, a name the Lokes made
<br>Famous: resplendent building, our tallest then;
<br>Fantastic camera shop; and that popular Store
<br>Where Rudy’s wife, petite, temporarily demure,
<br>Quietly assessed her customers as she held her
<br>Intelligence above show-cases. Two doors away,
<br>Heng, increasingly called Mr, sold German cameras
<br>To Japanese sailors, was en route to a partnership.
<br>
<br>And the bookshops full of stuff: Penguin New 
<br>Writing to Palgrave’s G-Treasury; Q’s Oxford 
<br>Anthology, a blue spine among mouldy issues 
<br>Of The Wide World where imperial dreams, 
<br>The White man’s burden trudged across Asia and
<br>Africa, up Ruwenzori’s mist and moon, then down
<br>The Brahmaputra. Mainly first-hand accounts, 
<br>Direct, unshorn, marching against superstition.
<br>Plain narratives rising in majesty, in power, art.
<br>No cute theory of the Other. Only them natives.
<br>
<br>And the Rendezvous after school; affordable.
<br>The man with the mole, ladle in hand, presided,
<br>Holding the extra spoonful, balanced fate,deciding
<br>If he liked you. Two doors away Simon Ong’s
<br>Family shop of fishing tackle, Winchester torches,
<br>Knives of Solingen steel. Outside, a Woodsville tram,
<br>Full of St Andrew boys, swings around the corner,
<br>Tires squealing.
<br>
<br>Standing there, the world grew,
<br>Bit by bit, seemed different with each fresh vantage
<br>Shift in weather; hormonal stir, sweet unknowing;
<br>An ache that knew no words; a quickly passing mouth.
<br>As eyes caught more lit with sensuous guilt, when 
<br>Curves beneath Convent uniforms heaved and turned
<br>With the mind’s proposal, the rainbow’s ripening,
<br>As thoughts fingered image, each chance encounter.
<br>Experience became a word as Life cease to be simple.
<br>
