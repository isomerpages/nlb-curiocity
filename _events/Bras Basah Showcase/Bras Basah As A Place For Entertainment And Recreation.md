#### **A Place for Entertainment and Recreation**

Ranging from cinemas and hotels to clubs and cultural institutions, Bras Basah was a place frequented by people in search of entertainment and recreation during the colonial period and nation-building years. While some of these places are no longer around, many still remain and are frequented by people from the current generation. 

The story map below lays out some of these places in Bras Basah.

#### **Cinemas in Bras Basah**

As many of Singapore's first cinemas were located within and near Bras Basah during the colonial and post-colonial years, the district could be considered as a place for cinemas, movies and blockbusters. The photo essay below lays out seven most iconic cinemas of Bras Basah.

-----

**Cathay Building**

Located at 2 Handy Road, [Cathay Building](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_532_2004-12-17.html){:target="_blank"} was originally made up of the current Cathay cineplex and a 16-storey tower. The former was completed in 1939, while the latter in 1941. At 83.5m tall, the tower was considered as Singapore’s first skyscraper and tallest building at the time.

| Cathay Building was used to house a cinema, hotel and restaurant. It was designed by Scottish architect Frank Wilmin Brewer of Arbenz and Brewer, and was commissioned by Mrs Loke Yew née Lim Cheng Kim and her son Loke Wan Tho, who established the cinema arm of the Loke business by establishing Associated Theatres in 1935, the predecessor of Cathay Organisation.

| The 1,300-seat cinema was located in the cineplex and was among the main highlights of the building. Not only it was the first fully air-conditioned public facility at the time, it had modern facilities including plush armchairs, broad aisles between rows of seats as well as box seats for distinguished guests. The proscenium was decorated in art-deco style with four modern pillars and a shell-shaped acoustic plaster design on the walls.

| The cinema opened on 3 October 1939 with the premiere of "The Four Feathers". Special guests for the show included then Colonial Secretary Alexander Small and Lady Small. Today, the Cathay tower had been torn down. But the cineplex was gazetted in 2003 as a historical landmark and was redeveloped into today's The Cathay (shown above).

**Odeon Theatre**

The [Odeon Cinema](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1143_2006-06-21.html){:target="_blank"} was built in 1953. Located at the junction of North Bridge Road and Cashin Street, it was Cathay Organisation’s flagship cinema and its most successful box-office earner in Singapore. Due to its prime location, the Odeon, during the nation-building years, was a favourite hangout for students of schools in the vicinity, including the St Joseph’s Institution, Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus, Catholic High and Raffles Institution.

|  Designed by architectural firm Palmer and Turner, Odeon was officially opened by then Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia Malcolm MacDonald at the charity premiere of "The Snows of Kilimanjaro", starring Gregory Peck, Susan Hayward and Ava Gardner in June 1953. Among those present were Twentieth Century Fox’s stars Constance Smith and Jeffrey Hunter. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b0432eee-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

|  The air-conditioned Odeon Cinema screened mainly first-run English-language films. It was equipped with four Gaumont-Kalee “21” projectors, which supported Stereophonic Sound, Vista Vision and Cinemascope. It became the first cinema under Cathay to use Cinemascope when The Robe, starring Richard Burton and Jean Simmons, was screened in 1953. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b529050a-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

|  In 1984, due to factors such as low cinema attendance and high property prices, Cathay Organisation sold Odeon to United Overseas Land. After screening its last firm, "Breakdance" on 30 June 1984, the building was subsequently demolished. Its former site is now occupied by Odeon Tower and K. H. Kea Building. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/d416d7e6-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

**Capitol Theatre**

The [Capitol Theatre](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_630_2004-12-15.html){:target="_blank"}, located at the junction of Stamford Road and North Bridge Road, was opened in 1930.  It was considered one of the finest cinemas of the time. Originally owned by the Namazie family, Capitol Theatre, along with the four-storey adjoining building then known as Namazie Mansions, was sold to Shaw Organisation after World War II.

|  Spanning more than 2,100 sq m, the Capitol Theatre had a neoclassical architecture designed by British architects P. H. Keys and F. Dowdeswell. They drew inspiration from the Roxy Theatre in New York, replicating its seating arrangements, lighting and general plan. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/066b3aa0-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

|  At its opening, the theatre was hailed as having the most modern auditorium with the largest capacity in the Far East. The theatre could accommodate at least 1,600, with 1,100 seated on the ground floor. Another 500 seats were available at the circle that could be accessed via lifts or staircases. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b41338a9-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

|  The Capitol had a large projection room, which was located below the balcony and ran the length of the building instead of being traditionally sited in the rear. It housed the latest Simplex projector and was installed with fireproof protection shutters. Designed expressly for talkies, the theatre’s acoustics and soundproofing were said to be exceptional. Today, Capitol Building, along with its surrounding buildings including the former Stamford House, is now part of the mixed-use redevelopment, Capitol Singapore, after it was conserved as a historical landmark.

**Rex Cinemas**

Rex Cinemas (or Rex Theatres) was located in a three-storey building along MacKenzie Road. Considered as one of the iconic cinemas in Singapore's entertainment history, Rex was also a familiar household name among many Singaporeans including the Indian community who lived in the Serangoon and Selegie area.

|  First opened in 1946 by the Shaw Brothers, with the screening of "The Jungle Book", Rex was known for its air-conditioned modernity as well as the tea rooms and restaurants. Back in its heyday during the 1970s, it was not unusual to see long queues snaking out of the cinema. It was said that moviegoers would show up early in the morning, long before the screening time, to purchase tickets before they sold out. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/afb7dba3-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

|  The large audience footfall also drew hawkers to set up makeshift stalls there at night for hungry moviegoers. In fact, popular eatery chain ‘Old Chang Kee’ started its business with a stall  opposite the Rex. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/97104dec-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |
| [![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-rex-3.jpg)](https://www.roots.gov.sg/places/places-landing/Places/surveyed-sites/Rex-Cinemas){:target="_blank"} |
|  By the 1980s, a dwindling cinema business forced the Rex to close its doors. The building, at different points in time, was then  used as a singing performance house, an ice rink, a church, and a disco. For a period between 2009 and 2018, the Rex returned to its roots and served its original purposes as a movie cinema screening Tamil and Hindi films. Eventually Rex ceased operation in 2018, and the building is currently not in use.

**Victoria Theatre**

The Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall (VTCH) along Empress Place is Singapore’s oldest performing arts venue. Gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992, the VTCH comprises two blocks of building constructed more than 43 years apart, in 1862 and 1905 respectively. They are joined by a 54-metre clock tower. Historically, VTCH was used for functions ranging from public events and political meetings to musical and stage performances.

|  The present theatre and concert hall were originally known as the Town Hall and Victoria Memorial Hall respectively. The Town Hall was designed by municipal engineer John Bennett to carry out the dual function as a theatre and office spaces for the municipality. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/ae820285-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

|  As for the Memorial Hall, it built to commemorate Queen Victoria. It was designed colonial engineer Alexander Murray and R. A. J. Bidwell from Swan & Maclaren. For the centennial celebrations in 1919 to commemorate 100 years since the founding of Singapore, the statue of Stamford Raffles was moved from the Padang to the front of Victoria Memorial Hall. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/ae3928d6-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"})|

|  Over the ears, VTCH has undergone a series of renovations. The most recent being a four-year restoration from 2010 to 2014 led by W Architects. After its completion, VTCH was reopened to the public in July 2014.

**Jubilee Theatre**

Jubilee Theatre or Kwang Hwa Theatre was located along North Bridge Road beside Raffles Hotel and opposite Odeon Theatre. Formerly known as Tivoli Hall, it was opened in 1929 and was among the first cinemas to be installed with the equipment to support "talkies" or sound films.

|  During the 1950s, Jubilee Theatre was the premier theatre for Cantonese films and bookings had to be weeks in advance. In the 1966, the theatre was brought over by Goh Eng Wah who would go on to establish the Eng Wah Theatres Organisation in 1968. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b00a59db-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

|  In 1978, however, Eng Wah Theatres had to close the 800-seat theatre permanently. This was due to its lack of modern facilities and declining business. It was said that the theatre's screen was unable to compete with the newer cinemas which are equipped with wider and better screens, more comfortable seats and carparks. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/896d4193-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

|  The theatre was later demolished to make way for the extension of Raffles Hotel when the latter won the bid to redevelop the site in the late 1980s into a Victorian-styled theatre playhouse. The new playhouse, known today as Jubilee Hall, is named after the site's former occupant - Jubilee Theatre.

**Royal Theatre and Diamond Theatre**

Located along North Bridge Road, Royal Theatre and Diamond Theatre were among the string of theatres that used to line the street. They both shared a common history as they were both built to hold bangsawan performances before shifting focus to become among the most popular cinemas screening movies for the Indian community. Both buildings, however, were demolished in the 1970s.

|  Royal Theatre was located at the current site Raffles Hospital. Originally called Theatre Royal, it is believed to be the first “permanent” theatre that staged bangsawan performances when it opened in 1908. Owned by Chinese Peranakan businessman Cheong Koon Seng, theatre's opening heralded the golden age of bangsawan in Singapore and Malaya which saw the proliferation of new bangsawan troupes including Cheong's Star Opera Company, and the increase in appetite for their performances.

|  When Cheong died in 1934, his theatre was sold to Amalgamated Theatres, the company managing Capitol and Pavilion cinemas. The company then turned it into a 1,100-seat cinema screening films from India, with the occasional live act from Indian theatrical and performing groups. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/maps_building_plans/record-details/df235cca-115c-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad)){:target="_blank"} |

|  Diamond Theatre was located just a few doors away at 499 North Bridge Road. Formerly called Alexandra Hall, it was leased by bangsawan troupe Opera Yap Chow Tong. As such, during its early days, the theatre was used to staged bangsawan performances. In 1947, similar to Royal Theatre, the theatre was converted into a 600-seat "first-rate" cinema specialising in Indian films. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b7b3a723-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad)){:target="_blank"} |

|  Both Diamond Theatre and Royal Theatre continued with their new leases of life as Indians cinemas until the late 1970s when the government announced its plans to renew the area, leading to the closure and demolition of the two theatres to make way for new development.
