#### **In Need For Renewal**

Up till the 1970s, Bras Basah and its adjacent district, Bugis, were abuzz with activities, thanks to the schools, book stores, cinemas, hawkers and nightlife in the two districts. But like other inner city areas, the streets were congested and its colonial era shophouses in dilapidated condition. 

To address these issues, the government led by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) released a series of Development Guide Plan (DGP) to renew the central built-up area including Bugis and Bras Basah. The renewal process saw many buildings being torn down and redeveloped.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#778899">Development Guide Plans (DGPs) are detailed short- to medium-term land-use plans completed between 1993 and 1998 as part of a comprehensive review of the Master Plan 1985. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the national land-use planning agency, divided Singapore into 55 planning areas and drew up a DGP for each of these areas. A blueprint of the living, working and leisure environment in Singapore, the 55 DGPs together formed the overall Master Plan 1998, which was gazetted on 22 January 1999. The URA released the first of its 55 DGPs in 1993. The final DGP was released in July 1998 for the Punggol area and included detailed plans for Punggol 21.</span>

#### **Becoming Bras Basah.Bugis**

By the late 1980s, the Bras Basah and Bugis districts had developed a new shine but were quieter and less vibrant than before. To rejuvenate the area, URA decided to develop it into a heritage, arts and learning enclave. To this end, the districts were branded as a single Bras Basah.Bugis (BBB) precinct. Guided by a development master plan, buildings in the areas including former schools grounds, cinemas and bookstores were redeveloped as offices, shopping centres and hotels. Some were conserved and repurposed as museums and cultural and heritage spaces.

The photographs below show the remarkable transformation that Bras Basah underwent since the 1980s.

#### **Remembering Bras Basah**

Over the past decade, there has been a proliferation of social memories on places in Singapore. Perhaps brought about by a sense of nostalgia or loss due to the rapid pace of development, these active attempts have provided us with a more personified accounts of places that were otherwise missing in history books. In many cases, the memories that were collected were not placed in cold storage. Rather they were readily shared in portals such as the Singapore Memory Project and other forms of creative expressions including murals, sketches and even poems. Below are a selected few.

**A Ode to Bras Basah**

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#778899">Where the first Rendezvous brooded
<br>By a row of old shophouses, since sadly slain,
<br>A special road began. A point of colonial
<br>Confluence: Dhoby Ghaut, the YWCA with
<br>Manicured tennis lawns for memsahibs who
<br>Then took tea and scones. Across a Shell kiosk
<br>Where Papa parked his Austin Seven, then off
<br>To Hock Hoe’s for piston rods and Radex
<br>
<br>Think of the names: Dhoby Ghaut, Prinsep St,
<br>The three Cathays, a name the Lokes made
<br>Famous: resplendent building, our tallest then;
<br>Fantastic camera shop; and that popular Store
<br>Where Rudy’s wife, petite, temporarily demure,
<br>Quietly assessed her customers as she held her
<br>Intelligence above show-cases. Two doors away,
<br>Heng, increasingly called Mr, sold German cameras
<br>To Japanese sailors, was en route to a partnership.
<br>
<br>And the bookshops full of stuff: Penguin New 
<br>Writing to Palgrave’s G-Treasury; Q’s Oxford 
<br>Anthology, a blue spine among mouldy issues 
<br>Of The Wide World where imperial dreams, 
<br>The White man’s burden trudged across Asia and
<br>Africa, up Ruwenzori’s mist and moon, then down
<br>The Brahmaputra. Mainly first-hand accounts, 
<br>Direct, unshorn, marching against superstition.
<br>Plain narratives rising in majesty, in power, art.
<br>No cute theory of the Other. Only them natives.
<br>
<br>And the Rendezvous after school; affordable.
<br>The man with the mole, ladle in hand, presided,
<br>Holding the extra spoonful, balanced fate,deciding
<br>If he liked you. Two doors away Simon Ong’s
<br>Family shop of fishing tackle, Winchester torches,
<br>Knives of Solingen steel. Outside, a Woodsville tram,
<br>Full of St Andrew boys, swings around the corner,
<br>Tires squealing.
<br>
<br>Standing there, the world grew,
<br>Bit by bit, seemed different with each fresh vantage
<br>Shift in weather; hormonal stir, sweet unknowing;
<br>An ache that knew no words; a quickly passing mouth.
<br>As eyes caught more lit with sensuous guilt, when 
<br>Curves beneath Convent uniforms heaved and turned
<br>With the mind’s proposal, the rainbow’s ripening,
<br>As thoughts fingered image, each chance encounter.
<br>Experience became a word as Life cease to be simple.
<br>
