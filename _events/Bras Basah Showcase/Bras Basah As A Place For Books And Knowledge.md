#### **Bookstores Along Bras Basah Road**

Mention [Bras Basah Road](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_227_2005-01-25.html){:target="_blank"} to a Singaporean who lived through the 1970s and “books, stationery and printing services” are among the words which may spring to mind. Back then, the road and those nearby such as [North Bridge Road](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_880_2004-12-28.html) and [Stamford Road](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_865_2005-01-24.html){:target="_blank"} used to house shophouses famous for such services. Some of the biggest names that once stood there included the Methodist Publishing House (MPH), Shanghai Book Company, Union Book Company and POPULAR Bookstore. Take a look at them through the photo essay below.

<summary><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#353839">In 2014, the Singapore Memory Project also collaborated with the Chou Sing Chu Foundation to embark on the irememberBookstore initiative – a ground up movement that involves the gathering of memories and stories from the public as well as independent bookstores, book chains and book lovers. Through the initiative, precious memories including those related to the bookstores on Bras Basah Road were collected. Below is one of them, contributed by Mr Yeo Hong Eng. Click here to a part of it.</span></summary>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#778899">"It was in one of the mornings of early January 1959, we went to Bras Basah Road via the No. 1 red and white Changi bus...I was lost for words when we walked along the corridors of the shops. Almost every shop was a bookshop – old and new. Periodicals, newspapers, weekenders, magazines..., school textbooks...,  fictional books, non-fiction books of varied different genres, stationery, etc. I felt groggy. To try to save a few dollars, we tried to hunt from the second-hand book stores. I remembered that I was excited when I got one of the books. It was entitled  “The World.” It was a Geography book. Then we proceeded to the book stores that sold new ones. We went in and out almost all the shops from the whole length of Bras Basah Road from Victoria Street to Prinsep Street...When I reached home I spent some time to wrap up those books I purchased with either brown Manila paper or expired monthly calendar with the unprinted back facing out. I found it too precious to dog-ear my books to indicate the pages that I stop referring to. I used chicken feathers as bookmarks. I was excited when I saw some fine feathers actually ‘growing’ from the main ones. I could not believe it. But when checked with some adult friends, they confirmed that feathers put in between books could grow. Surprise? Surprise? Surprise? That was my first experience of book purchasing." </span>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#778899">Xinyao (新谣) is a genre of music that typically refers to Mandarin ballads composed, written and performed by youths in Singapore. Started in the late 1970s, xinyao was at its peak in the 1980s and propelled many local singers and singer-songwriters to stardom, several of whom successfully transitioned to the commercial sector. Big names often associated with the xinyao movement include Eric Moo (巫启贤), Billy Koh (许环良), Liang Wern Fook (梁文福) and Roy Loi (黎沸挥).</span>

#### **The Schools of Bras Basah**

The students that usually thronged the bookshops along Bras Basah Road and North Bridge Road were from schools across the island as well as those within Bras Basah. The story map below shows where these Bras Basah schools were once located in the district.

#### **The National Library and the National Museum**

Besides the schools and the bookstores, Bras Basah was and continues to be a place for knowledge. This is largely because of the presence of both the National Library and National Museum in the district since the mid-1800s. 

**The National Library**

The [former National Library Building](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_661_2004-12-27.html) was located at 91 Stamford Road. It was officially opened on 12 November 1960. Between 1887 and 1960, the National Library previously occupied the western wing of the Raffles Museum (now the National Museum of Singapore) at Stamford Road.

| The building was designed by the Public Works Department architect, Lionel Bintley while the project architect was Tio Seng Chin. The completed library had a reinforced concrete framed structure and was easily recognised for its iconic red brick walls which was a reflection of the epoch of British architecture in the 1950s.

| The total floor area of the new building was 101,500 sq ft. The ground floor comprised the exhibition hall, adult lending library, children’s library, children’s activities room and lecture hall. The mezzanine floor, on the other hand, housed administrative offices and a stack area, while the first floor held the reference library, microfilm reading room and a conference room. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b9563d72-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |
| [![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/bb-library-3.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:National_Library,_Singapore_-_20090706.jpg) |
| In 1998, it was announced that the National Library on Stamford Road would be demolished to make way for the Singapore Management University (SMU) and the construction of Fort Canning tunnel. Although there were calls to preserve the building, it was carried out. Today, the National Library in located in an ultra-modern building located on Victoria Street. However, the gates of the old library could still be found within the premises of SMU.

**The National Museum**

With its wide facade and large dome, the [National Museum of Singapore](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2015-08-31_132917.html){:target="_blank"} has been a prominent landmark on Stamford Road for over a century. Gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992, it is Singapore’s oldest existing museum, currently devoted to the general history of Singapore.

| The establishment of a museum was first mooted in 1823, when Sir Stamford Raffles proposed founding a college in Singapore. However, it was not realised until 1849. Set up within the Singapore Library, it was located together with the library in the premises of the Singapore Institution (today's Raffles Institution) (shown above) before moving to the Town Hall (present-day Victoria Theatre) in 1862. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/d5418d0c-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

|[![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/bb-museum-2.jpg)](https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1189977)]|
| In 1874, the museum and the Singapore Library were combined to form the Raffles Library and Museum. However, it would take more than a decade before the new institution was moved to the museum's present building in 1887. Designed by Colonial Engineer Henry E. McCallum, it was built in a neo-Palladian style, characterised by a highly symmetrical facade, as well as the use of pediments above the windows, Doric columns and pilasters on the ground level and Ionic pilasters on the second level.

|[![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/bb-museum-4.jpg)](https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1062247)|
| Initially, the museum was positioned as repository of zoological specimens, documenting the natural history of Singapore and the region. Towards the end of the 1800s, it expanded its collection to  portraits, plans and photographs of old Singapore. After the museum was separated from the library and following Singapore's independence, it shifted its focus to reflect the nation’s culture and history.
