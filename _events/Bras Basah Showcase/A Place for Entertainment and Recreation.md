#### **A Place for Entertainment and Recreation**

Ranging from cinemas and hotels to clubs and cultural institutions, Bras Basah was a place frequented by people in search of entertainment and recreation during the colonial period and nation-building years. While some of these places are no longer around, many still remain and are frequented by people from the current generation. 

The story map below lays out some of these places in Bras Basah.

Besides the story map, these entertainment and recreation spaces were also featured in historical audiovisual materials from the past available at the National Archives of Singapore or websites, blogs or social media channels maintained by heritage experts including the YouTube channel of Dutch photographer [Michael Rogge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCrh2WbJCp4&list=PLEF0C03E544562464).
