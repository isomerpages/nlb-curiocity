Lambert & Co. engaging in it. Click to read how the Twentieth Century Impression of British Malaya (1908) describes the studio's turnover.</span></summary>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#778899">Where the first Rendezvous brooded
<br>By a row of old shophouses, since sadly slain,
<br>A special road began. A point of colonial
<br>Confluence: Dhoby Ghaut, the YWCA with
<br>Manicured tennis lawns for memsahibs who
<br>Then took tea and scones. Across a Shell kiosk
<br>Where Papa parked his Austin Seven, then off
<br>To Hock Hoe’s for piston rods and Radex
<br>
<br>Think of the names: Dhoby Ghaut, Prinsep St,
<br>The three Cathays, a name the Lokes made
<br>Famous: resplendent building, our tallest then;
<br>Fantastic camera shop; and that popular Store
<br>Where Rudy’s wife, petite, temporarily demure,
<br>Quietly assessed her customers as she held her
<br>Intelligence above show-cases. Two doors away,
<br>Heng, increasingly called Mr, sold German cameras
<br>To Japanese sailors, was en route to a partnership.
<br>
<br>And the bookshops full of stuff: Penguin New 
<br>Writing to Palgrave’s G-Treasury; Q’s Oxford 
<br>Anthology, a blue spine among mouldy issues 
<br>Of The Wide World where imperial dreams, 
<br>The White man’s burden trudged across Asia and
<br>Africa, up Ruwenzori’s mist and moon, then down
<br>The Brahmaputra. Mainly first-hand accounts, 
<br>Direct, unshorn, marching against superstition.
<br>Plain narratives rising in majesty, in power, art.
<br>No cute theory of the Other. Only them natives.
<br>
<br>And the Rendezvous after school; affordable.
<br>The man with the mole, ladle in hand, presided,
<br>Holding the extra spoonful, balanced fate,deciding
<br>If he liked you. Two doors away Simon Ong’s
<br>Family shop of fishing tackle, Winchester torches,
<br>Knives of Solingen steel. Outside, a Woodsville tram,
<br>Full of St Andrew boys, swings around the corner,
<br>Tires squealing.
<br>
<br>Standing there, the world grew,
<br>Bit by bit, seemed different with each fresh vantage
<br>Shift in weather; hormonal stir, sweet unknowing;
<br>An ache that knew no words; a quickly passing mouth.
<br>As eyes caught more lit with sensuous guilt, when 
<br>Curves beneath Convent uniforms heaved and turned
<br>With the mind’s proposal, the rainbow’s ripening,
<br>As thoughts fingered image, each chance encounter.
<br>Experience became a word as Life cease to be simple.
<br>
