#### **A Place for Food**

Other than being a place for entertainment and recreation, Bras Basah was also known for its restaurants, coffee shops and cafes. Patronised by students and residents either staying nearby or from different parts of the island, these places clearly show that Singapore's foodie culture has a history longer than most people think. Below is a photo essay that highlights some of these eating places.

**Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant**

The premises of today's Hotel Rendezvous  at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Prinsep Street was once occupied by a stretch of shophouses. Constructed during the early 1900s, they were known for their businesses which included a hotel, photography studios,  sport equipment shops, bookshops and coffe shops. The most famous of them, however, was Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant.

|Considered as one of Singapore's finest Nasi Padang restaurants then, it started off as a coffeeshop before becoming a pub and restaurant serving Chinese and Western food to British forces.

|In 1987, the restaurant moved out of its Bras Basah premises to Raffles City. Today, it is located at The Central in Clarke Quay. However, its presence in Bras Basah was so memorable that the hotel which occupied its former site named itself after it.

I remember the glass windows decorated with gold letters, through which one could see the rows of Nasi Padang dishes displayed on the shelves of the glass cabinet beside the window."</span>

**Long Bar and the Singapore Sling**

The Long Bar in Raffles Hotel was among the oldest food establishments in the Bras Basah area.  Sharing a history with the hotel itself, it was a popular haunt among plantation owners during the early 1900s and was commonly referred to as the ‘Rendezvous of Planters’ at the time.

| Back then, Long Bar was not a formal bar. Rather it was just tables and chairs placed next to each other in the Cad Alley wing of the hotel facing Bras Basah Road. Visitors would use them to mingle and relax with drinks and snacks. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/88ad427e-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"})|

| The bar is most well-known as the birthplace of the Singapore Sling which is an internationally recognised cocktail created by the hotel's bartender Ngiam Tong Boon in 1915. Primarily a gin-based cocktail, Ngiam made the beverage pink so as to allow the ladies at the time to consume it in the public.

**Hainanese Chicken Rice**

As the [Hainanese chicken rice](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_910_2005-01-11.html){:target="_blank"} is said to have taken root in areas like Middle Road and Purvis Street during the pre-war years, Bras Basah could be seen as the place of origin for the beloved local fare.

| The link between the Hainanese Chicken Rice as the name implies is due to the Hainanese community. Originated from Hainan province in China, they, like the other Chinese communities here, formed enclaves and settled in different parts of Singapore including the Bras Basah area. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/0510e575-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"})|

| In fact, the around Bras Basah was a Hainanese enclave. Other than the presence of the Hainan Clan Association which still stands prominently along Seah Street today, Middle Road, Purvis Street and Seah Street were used to be called "Hainan First Street", "Hainan Second Street", and "Hainan Third Street" respectively. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/10d01f55-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"})|

| However, the Hainanese chicken rice was not the only famous delicacy that they created. There were others including Hainanese-inspired Western dishes (think Hainanese pork chops) and our local Nanyang coffee which in turn led to the creation of kopitams (or coffee shops).

**Red House**

At the junction of Bras Basah Road and Victoria Street opposite present day CHIJMES where the Carlton Hotel now stands, there used to be a bakery known as the Red House. Due to its reasonably price set meals as well as signature cakes and curry puffs, it was very popular among the residents there and students who used to study in the area. The Red House was also said to be the place where eminent local watercolourist [Ong Kim Seng](https://www.esplanade.com/offstage/arts/ong-kim-seng) would meet fellow painters every Sunday before heading to the Singapore River to paint during his younger days in the 1960s.

The bakery also operated a café on the second storey where one could have a “set lunch” – a three course meal, with a soup, a main course, and a dessert, with coffee or tea for $5, during lunch time."</span>

**Street Hawkers of Old Bras Basah**

During the pre-war years up till the late 1970s, the streets of Bras Basah, like many parts of the city area, were once lined with street hawkers. A trade that is considered as one of the most important components of our local heritage, food hawking has been around since the early 1800s, offering a livelihood for the early immigrants of Singapore.

| The street hawkers of old Bras Basah could be found in places such as Middle Street and Queen Street. The former was lined with mostly Malay hawkers, while the latter Chinese. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b67c970b-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"})|

| One of the most popular street food in the area was satay. In fact, the Satay Club that we know today in Gardens by the Bay started its days along a now expunged short thoroughfare near Middle Road known as Hoi How Road. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/6006ea41-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"})|

| Waterloo Street was another place in Bras Basah where street hawkers could be found. Famous for its Indian rojak and sarabat stalls, some of them were generations old, with their origins stretching as far back as the late 1800s. (Photo via [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/546413367275494712/){:target="_blank"})|

Today, these Bras Bash street hawkers have been relocated to proper hawker centres including the nearby Albert Centre Market and Food Centre. However, their legacy lives on. Watch the videos below by Channel NewsAsia and the National Heritage Board as well as independent filmmakers including digital video publisher [Our Grandfather Story](https://ourgrandfatherstory.com/) to learn not only about the Indian rojak dish that gave Waterloo Street its food heritage trademark, but the history of our hawkers culture.

<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#778899">"Running perpendicular to Bras Basah was a street named Waterloo Street. What was thought to be the best Indian Rojak in Singapore was found among the row of maybe five or six “sarabat” stalls along Waterloo Street close to where it crosses Bras Basah Road. I frequented the stalls at least once a week for a while, not so much for the Indian Rojak, but for the Mee Rebus, a dish of boiled noodles covered in a thick brown gravy. One of the stalls offered a unique variation of the dish with a very nutty version of the gravy which I enjoyed on my weekly visits."</span>
