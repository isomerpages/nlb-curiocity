#### **A Place for Food**

Other than being a place for entertainment and recreation, Bras Basah was also known for its restaurants, coffee shops and cafes. Patronised by students and residents either staying nearby or from different parts of the island, these places clearly show that Singapore's foodie culture has a history longer than most people think. Below is a photo essay that highlights some of these eating places.

**Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant**

The premises of today's Hotel Rendezvous  at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Prinsep Street was once occupied by a stretch of shophouses. Constructed during the early 1900s, they were known for their businesses which included a hotel, photography studios,  sport equipment shops, bookshops and coffe shops. The most famous of them, however, was Rendezvous (or Hock Lock Kee) Nasi Padang Restaurant.

|Considered as one of Singapore's finest Nasi Padang restaurants then, it started off as a coffeeshop before becoming a pub and restaurant serving Chinese and Western food to British forces. |

|When the restaurant's British clientele began to dwindle during the 1950s, its then owner Seah Soo Khoon brought in a chef from West Sumatra and began serving Nasi Padang. |

|In 1987, the restaurant moved out of its Bras Basah premises to Raffles City. Today, it is located at The Central in Clarke Quay. However, its presence in Bras Basah was so memorable that the hotel which occupied its former site named itself after it.|

**Long Bar and the Singapore Sling**

The Long Bar in Raffles Hotel was among the oldest food establishments in the Bras Basah area.  Sharing a history with the hotel itself, it was a popular haunt among plantation owners during the early 1900s and was commonly referred to as the ‘Rendezvous of Planters’ at the time.

|Back then, Long Bar was not a formal bar. Rather it was just tables and chairs placed next to each other in the Cad Alley wing of the hotel facing Bras Basah Road. Visitors would use them to mingle and relax with drinks and snacks.|

|The bar is most well-known as the birthplace of the Singapore Sling which is an internationally recognised cocktail created by the hotel's bartender Ngiam Tong Boon in 1915. Primarily a gin-based cocktail, Ngiam made the beverage pink so as to allow the ladies at the time to consume it in the public.|

**Hainanese Chicken Rice**

As the Hainanese chicken rice dish is said to have taken root in areas like Middle Roada and Purvis Street during the pre-war years, Bras Basah could be seen as the place of origins for the beloved delicacy.

|The link between the Hainanese Chicken Rice as the name implies is due to the Hainanese community. Originated from Hainan province in China, they, like the other Chinese communities here, formed enclaves and settled in different parts of Singapore including the Bras Basah area.|
| [![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-chicken-rice-2.jpg)](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/0510e575-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad)   |
|In fact, the around Bras Basah was a Hainanese enclave. Other than the presence of the Hainan Clan Association which still stands prominently along Seah Street today, Middle Road, Purvis Street and Seah Street were used to be called "Hainan First Street", "Hainan Second Street", and "Hainan Third Street" respectively.|

|However, the Hainanese chicken rice was not the only famous delicacy that they created. There were others including Hainanese-inspired Western dishes (think Hainanese pork chops) and our local Nanyang coffee which in turn led to the creation of kopitams (or coffee shops).|

**Red House**

The Red House Bakery is a popular reference to a relict confectionery shop known as Katong Bakery & Confectionery. As the name implies, it was from Katong but had another branch at the junction of Bras Basah Road and Victoria Street opposite present day CHIJMES.

**Street Hawkers of Old Bras Basah**

During the pre-war years up till the late 1970s, the streets of Bras Basah, like many parts of the city area, were once lined with street hawkers. A trade that is considered as one of the most important components of our local heritage, food hawking has been around since the early 1800s, offering a livelihood for the early immigrants of Singapore.

|The street hawkers of old Bras Basah could be found in places such as Middle Street and Queen Street. The former was lined with Malay and Javanese hawkers selling not only food like satay, but also crafts and curios. As for the latter, one could find Chinese hawkers selling cooked food and a variety of products such as food stuffs, vegetables and apparel.|
|[![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/sample-bb-hawkers-3.jpg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/546413367275494712/) |
| Waterloo Street was another place in Bras Basah where street hawkers could be found. Famous for its Indian rojak and sarabat stalls, some of them were generations old, with their origins stretching as far back as the late 1800s.|

Today, these Bras Bash street hawkers have been relocated to proper hawker centres including the nearby Albert Centre Market and Food Centre. However, their legacy lives on. Watch the videos below by Channel NewsAsia and the National Heritage Board as well as independent filmmakers including digital video publisher [Our Grandfather Story](https://ourgrandfatherstory.com/) to learn not only about the Indian rojak dish that gave Waterloo Street its food heritage trademark, but the history of our hawkers culture.
