Bras Basah is among the oldest districts in Singapore. Situated within the European part of [Sir Stamford Raffles’s](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_715_2004-12-15.html) 1822 plan for the town of Singapore or the [Raffles Town Plan](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_658_2005-01-07.html), it served as the suburb to the busy city centre which wrapped itself around [Commercial Square](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_864_2004-12-30.html) (now known as Raffles Place). Over the next two centuries, Bras Basah would grow spectacularly resulting in the establishments of schools, religious buildings and some of the finest colonial structures in Singapore.

But why is it called this way? Click to read how Victor Savage and Brenda Yeoh (2013) explain in their <a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/item_holding.aspx?bid=200123850">book</a>.</span></summary>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#778899">The road was so-called because in the early days, wet rice was laid to dry here on the banks of the "fresh water stream" (now the Stamford Canal). Another version is that before the area before Bras Basah Road and Stamford was filled in, cargoes of rice were brought by boats into the lagoon and spread to dry on the road. One one occasion, high tides wet the rice.</span>

#### **Depiction of Early Bras Basah in Postcards**

The first postcard in the Straits Settlements was issued in 1879. However, it was only until the late 1890s after the British postal authorities allowed privately printed postcards to be despatched at the same inexpensive postal rate as government issued ones that pictures began to appear on the otherwise blank postcards. A genre of picture postcards that quickly gained popularity was those that showed local views including the physical landscape of Singapore. Today these postcards, which can be found in the collections of the National Archives of Singapore and National Museum of Singapore, are able to provide us with an invaluable of the past.
