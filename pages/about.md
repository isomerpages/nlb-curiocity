<span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">Curiocity is a National Library Board website that uses Story Maps and Digital Stories to tell interactive and compelling stories about the history of places in Singapore.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">Story maps</span> are a type of digital map that integrates text, images, and other multimedia resources to tell a story about a place or topic. They are created using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software and typically feature interactive maps with clickable points of interest that reveal additional information or multimedia content when clicked on.

<span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">Digital Stories</span> are multimedia narratives that combine text and various forms of multimedia resources such as photographs, videos, music, and text, to convey a message or tell a story. They often incorporate personal stories and memories to create a more engaging and authentic storytelling experience.

<span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">In Curiocity, the photographs and multimedia resources used to supplement the written text in the Story Maps and Digital Stories are digitised materials from the collections of the NLB, the National Archives of Singapore (NAS), the Heritage Board (NHB) and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), specifically photographs, maps, paintings, postcards, artefacts, memories and oral history interviews.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">Curiocity</span> is part of the NLBâ€™s <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">Library and Archives Blueprint (LAB25)</span> <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">Singapore Storytellers</span> initiative where NLB aims to curate and spotlight stories that capture the Singapore experience. This is to inspire the discovery and creation of more Singapore stories and instil a deeper appreciation of our collective experience.
