The Curiocity festival aims to promote Singapore history and proliferate NLB’s collections outside of the libraries and archives, where people can access them physically, digitally or via our programmes. Through collaborations with various partners, this inaugural edition has a thematic focus on places and perspectives, and is held in partnership with the Light to Night Festival 2022.
