The Light to Night Festival is back with an even bigger line-up! In its second edition, the festival explores the sensation of colours through spectacular facade shows across major cultural institutions and parks in the Civic District. On the weekends, late night programmes around the precinct will bring the experience of colours alive. Five new commissions by renowned artists from the region—Ho Tzu Nyen, Lee Mingwei, David Medalla and Pinaree Sanpitak—and "ultratechnologists" teamLab will also be unveiled.
