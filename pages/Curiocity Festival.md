The Curiocity festival aims to promote Singapore history and proliferate NLBâ€™s collections outside of the libraries and archives, where people can access them physically, digitally or via our programmes.

Through collaborations with various partners, this inaugural edition has a thematic focus on places and perspectives, and is held in partnership with the Light to Night Festival 2022.
