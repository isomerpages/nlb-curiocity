Established in 1887, Raffles Hotel is an award-winning colonial-era hotel with a rich history. It is well known for its period architecture and decor, luxurious accommodation and fine cuisine. The hotel is particularly known for its popular Tiffin Room buffet and for the Singapore Sling cocktail created in 1915. Before becoming Raffles Hotel, it began as Beach House, a private home built in the 1830s by Robert Scott. In 1878, Charles Emmerson leased the building and opened Emmersonâ€™s Hotel. After his sudden death in 1883, the hotel was reopened as Hotel Des Indes before being leased to the Armenian Sarkies brothers Martin, Tigran, Aviet and Arshak. They would rename it as "Raffles Hotel" and turn it into one of the most luxurious hotels at the time. Today, the hotel continues to be one of the best in the world and was gazetted as a national monument in 1987 and again in 1995.
