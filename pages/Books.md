#### **Schools of Bras Basah**

Raffles Institution

Raffles Institution is one of the oldest schools. Although its foundation stone was laid in 1823, its history stretches back to 1819 when Sir Stamford Raffles proposed the establishment of a premier learning institution. Initially known as Singapore Institution, it was renamed Raffles Institution in 1868, and it was originally located at Bras Basah Road. However, it later moved to Grange Road in the early 1970s and then Bishan where it remains today. Its former site is currently occupied by Raffles City Shopping Centre.

CHIJ

Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) is the oldest Catholic girls’ school in Singapore. Founded in 1854 by the French sisters of the Congregation of the Holy Infant Jesus, the school was established at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Victoria Street (present site of CHIJMES). In December 1983, the school moved to a new site in Toa Payoh to make way for the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) headquarters. Following the move, its primary and secondary sections were renamed CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh) and CHIJ Secondary (Toa Payoh).

Raffles Girls' School

Raffles Girls' School started as a one-room department within Raffles Institution in 1844 before it was officially established in 1879 with 77 students. As the school expanded, it moved to a new premises in Queen Street in 1928 and became a full-fledged girls’ school. In 1959, the school moved again to Anderson Road before settling on its present Braddell Rise campus in 2019. Today, the school's former Bras Basah site is occupied by the Singapore Management University's School of Business.

St Jospeh's Institution

St Jospeh's Institution (SJI) was founded in 1852 by Father Jean-Marie Beurel of the Missions Étrangères de Paris (The Society of Foreign Missions of Paris). Before moving to its current location on Malcolm Road in 1988, it used to occupied the present site of the Singapore Art Museum along Bras Basah Road. This building was completed in 1867 and comprised a cluster of blocks featuring a classical style reminiscent of the European Renaissance. Today, this building is a national monument after it was gazetted on 14 February 1992.

Stamford Girls' School

Stamford Girls' School was established in January 1951 and it used to occupy a double-storey building at 155 Waterloo Street. It later became Stamford Primary School in January 1984 after it merged with Waterloo Primary School. In March 1986, the school was relocated to Victoria Lane. Its former premises at Waterloo Street was then occupied by the Singapore Japanese Preparatory School followed by Shackle Club and Gan Eng Seng School. Today, it is home to the Stamford Arts Centre.

Selegie Integrated School

Selegie Integrated School, currently known as Selegie Primary School, was established in 1963. It used to occupy a 10-storey tall building at the junction of Selegie Road and Short Street. This building was considered at the time one of the tallest schools in Southeast Asia and the first high-rise school building in Singapore. It could house an estimated 1500 students in a single session. and had 2 canteens on separate floors. It also had 2 large cargo-size lifts to cater to the large number of students. Today, the former grounds of Selegie Primary School is occupied by a student hostel and a private education institution.

The origins of St Anthony’s Convent could be traced to August 1879 when Father José Pedro Sta Anna de Cunha of St Joseph’s Church (Portuguese Mission) set up St Anna’s School for the children of poor parishioners who could not afford school fees. At the time, the school was located in a two-storey shophouse on Middle Road and it began with only three teachers and six students. In February 1886, St Anna’s School was renamed St Anthony Boys’ and Girls’ School after a new school building was constructed on Middle Road, using funds from the Portuguese Mission, government subsidies as well as public donations.

Nan Hwa Girl’s Chinese School started as a makeshift school in Coleman Street with fewer than 100 Chinese girls before moving to a proper building along Bencoolen Street in 1921. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the school population grew as the school not only provided education for students, but also basic training for teachers. To cope with the rise in enrolment,  a second move was initiated and the school ended up at Adis Road.

St Margaret’s School is Singapore’s oldest girls' school. Established established at a time when the education of women was considered unimportant in 1842 by missionary Maria Dyer, it began as a missionary effort to save and educate mui tsai (“Little sister” in Cantonese), or bonded domestic servant. In 1960, the secondary-school section separated from the primary-school section and moved to a new school building on Farrer Road. The primary school is presently located at 99 Wilkie Road, while the secondary school is at 111 Farrer Road.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#778899">"It was in one of the mornings of early January 1959, we went to Bras Basah Road via the No. 1 red and white Changi bus...I was lost for words when we walked along the corridors of the shops. Almost every shop was a bookshop – old and new. Periodicals, newspapers, weekenders, magazines..., school textbooks...,  fictional books, non-fiction books of varied different genres, stationery, etc. I felt groggy. To try to save a few dollars, we tried to hunt from the second-hand book stores. I remembered that I was excited when I got one of the books. It was entitled  “The World.” It was a Geography book. Then we proceeded to the book stores that sold new ones. We went in and out almost all the shops from the whole length of Bras Basah Road from Victoria Street to Prinsep Street...When I reached home I spent some time to wrap up those books I purchased with either brown Manila paper or expired monthly calendar with the unprinted back facing out. I found it too precious to dog-ear my books to indicate the pages that I stop referring to. I used chicken feathers as bookmarks. I was excited when I saw some fine feathers actually ‘growing’ from the main ones. I could not believe it. But when checked with some adult friends, they confirmed that feathers put in between books could grow. Surprise? Surprise? Surprise? That was my first experience of book purchasing." </span>

The Big Book, The World Book, Popular Book Store, Shanghai Book Store, United Publishing House, The Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Co, Nanyang Book Company etc were there. These companies were not strangers to me. As I was the Head of English Department in Gongshang Primary School then, every year I received numerous review copies of children’s books, assessment books, model compositions, etc from these various publishers and book companies. The most popular was the Popular Book Store as it was the biggest bilingual and most attractive store there. Many of my sons’ reference and story books were from there. One of the best buys was a set of Children’s Encyclopaedia which I still have today...Today the Popular Book Store not only sell Chinese and English books, school text and assessment books, stationery etc, it also sells music CDs, DVDs, computer printers, games, and other software." </span>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#778899">Xinyao (新谣) is a genre of music that typically refers to Mandarin ballads composed, written and performed by youths in Singapore. Started in the late 1970s, xinyao was at its peak in the 1980s and propelled many local singers and singer-songwriters to stardom, several of whom successfully transitioned to the commercial sector.

Once you have finished your schooling this year, you go to the second-hand book shop in Bras Basah Road…On the left-hand side opposite what used to be the YMCA Tennis Court and across Bencoolen Street there were also three or four, where books, second-hand books were sold…when it came to around December before schools reopen in January, everybody would rush to go and get the books…depending on the price and the condition, you could bargain over the price, of course the few cents, whereas the other costs three or four times as much. So those who could not afford better type one would take even tatted ones…basic thing was they all contained the same material in different conditions of wear and year. So every year, you finished with your book for this year, unless you have children who are going to come in the next year or two, you keep them at home rather than go and sell and re-buy…I think they are all printed by the Malaya Publishing House or so, the premier publishing house in those days.</span>

#### **The National Museum and National Library**

Besides the schools and the bookstores, Bras Basah was and continues to be a place for knowledge. This is largely because of the presence of both the National Library and National Museum in the district since the mid-1800s. 

**The National Museum**

With its wide facade and large dome, the [National Museum of Singapore](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2015-08-31_132917.html){:target="_blank"} has been a prominent landmark on Stamford Road for over a century. Gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992, it is Singapore’s oldest existing museum, currently devoted to the general history of Singapore.

| The establishment of a museum was first mooted in 1823, when Sir Stamford Raffles proposed founding a college in Singapore. However, it was not realised until 1849. Set up within the Singapore Library, it was located together with the library in the premises of the Singapore Institution (today's Raffles Institution) (shown above) before moving to the Town Hall (present-day Victoria Theatre) in 1862. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/d5418d0c-1161-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

|[![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/bb-museum-2.jpg)](https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1189977){:target="_blank"}|
| In 1874, the museum and the Singapore Library were combined to form the Raffles Library and Museum. However, it would take more than a decade before the new institution was moved to the museum's present building in 1887. Designed by Colonial Engineer Henry E. McCallum, it was built in a neo-Palladian style, characterised by a highly symmetrical facade, as well as the use of pediments above the windows, Doric columns and pilasters on the ground level and Ionic pilasters on the second level.

|[![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/bb-museum-4.jpg)](https://www.roots.gov.sg/Collection-Landing/listing/1062247){:target="_blank"} |
| Initially, the museum was positioned as repository of zoological specimens, documenting the natural history of Singapore and the region. Towards the end of the 1800s, it expanded its collection to  portraits, plans and photographs of old Singapore. After the museum was separated from the library and following Singapore's independence, it shifted its focus to reflect the nation’s culture and history.

**The National Library**

The [former National Library Building](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_661_2004-12-27.html) was located at 91 Stamford Road. It was officially opened on 12 November 1960. Between 1887 and 1960, the National Library previously occupied the western wing of the Raffles Museum (now the National Museum of Singapore) at Stamford Road.

| The building was designed by the Public Works Department architect, Lionel Bintley while the project architect was Tio Seng Chin. The completed library had a reinforced concrete framed structure and was easily recognised for its iconic red brick walls which was a reflection of the epoch of British architecture in the 1950s.

| The total floor area of the new building was 101,500 sq ft. The ground floor comprised the exhibition hall, adult lending library, children’s library, children’s activities room and lecture hall. The mezzanine floor, on the other hand, housed administrative offices and a stack area, while the first floor held the reference library, microfilm reading room and a conference room. (Photo via [National Archives of Singapore](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b9563d72-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad){:target="_blank"}) |

| In 1998, it was announced that the National Library on Stamford Road would be demolished to make way for the Singapore Management University (SMU) and the construction of Fort Canning tunnel. Although there were calls to preserve the building, it was carried out. Today, the National Library in located in an ultra-modern building located on Victoria Street. However, the gates of the old library could still be found within the premises of SMU.

**Little Red Bricks**

Though the old National library was demolished almost 15 years ago in 2004, it will forever live on in the memories of the countless amount of Singaporeans that frequented it over the decades. Local animation studio Robot Playground has decided to take it one step further by immortalising the National Library in a 15-minute animated short titled “Little Red Bricks” that pays tribute to not only the building itself but the people as well through the the life and times of a boy and a girl. Watch the breathtaking video below.

I remember when I was in Secondary Two and had to do a project on science in sport - how there was only a single book in the library system which was located in the national reference library...I remember that it was there that I learned how to operate the microfiche machines, in search for newspaper reports on the Hock Lee Bus strikes; that when in Secondary Four, how my classmates and I did a project on creation and evolution and ended up chatting with girls from an assortment of schools while waiting in the photocopy queues. I remember how as a 17-year-old I discovered Jack Keroauc and Ken Kesey and an assortment of poets and writes on lonely Sunday afternoons - books that had lain unborrowed for years, on the shelves of the library and greedily calculated how many I could check out. These were the days before the Internet, before Borders or Kinokuniya and the National Library certainly expanded my horizons." </span>

There was the MPH at the Stamford Road side…they mostly sell I think textbooks and locally printed textbooks such as Mrs Handy Cookbook and their own range of workbook and stationery. For example, there was a workbook there for local schools showing a policeman with wings…[these] are [actually] boards sticking out from their backs so that they are more visible when they direct traffic. I think that was the intention. Obviously it was real wings so that he could fly after crooks to catch them.
