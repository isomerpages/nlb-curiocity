### **Early Bras Basah In Maps**

Bras Basah is one of the oldest districts in Singapore. Situated within the European part of Stamford Raffles’s 1822 plan for the town of Singapore (also known as the Raffles Town Plan), it served as the suburb just outside of Commercial Square (now known as Raffles Place). Over the next two centuries, Bras Basah would flourish: schools were established, religious buildings and some of the finest colonial structures in Singapore were constructed.

Besides showing the location of the ethnic enclaves that Raffles envisioned with the Town Planning Committee in 1822, the map also noted that Bras Basah Road was initially known as Church Street and Selegy Street.

### **Early Bras Basah in Prints and Paintings**

During the 19th century, much of Singapore’s early growth and progress, including those in Bras Basah, was recorded in topographical prints. Usually published in the accounts of scientific voyages, travel books or bound folios, they form a historically significant and visually pleasing source of information on the settlement’s history. Below are a selected few but more could be found in publications produced by the National Museum of Singapore as well as its collection made available in [Roots](https://www.roots.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}.

Among the many talented painters, the one who stood out the most is John Turnbull Thomson. His paintings are said to have captured much of Singapore’s built landscape in the mid-1840s and its cultural diversity. But who is he? Click or tap here to find out.</span></summary>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:#eb7044">John Turnbull Thomson was the Government Surveyor of the Straits Settlements from 1841 to 1853. He made a number of important contributions during his 12 years in Singapore, including the creation of maps of early Singapore, as well as the design and construction of several buildings and other public infrastructure on the island. A self-taught artist and prolific writer, Thomson’s collection of paintings, books and articles now serve as invaluable records of the architecture and life of early Singapore.</span>

### **Early Bras Basah in Postcards**

The first postcard in the Straits Settlements was issued in 1879. However, it was not only until the late 1890s when the British postal authorities allowed privately printed postcards to be despatched at the same inexpensive postal rate as government issued ones that pictures began to appear on the otherwise blank postcards. Picture postcards showing local views and landscapes of Singapore quickly gained popularity. Today, these postcards, which can be found in the collections of the National Archives of Singapore and National Museum of Singapore, paint an invaluable picture of the past.
